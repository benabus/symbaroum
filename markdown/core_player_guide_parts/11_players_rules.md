## Players Rules

THE FOLLOWING SECTION covers the rules that you, as a player, are expected to know: the rules for combat, dying and healing. Problem-solving and social challenges are only discussed briefly, since it is the Game Master's job to handle the rules involving those kinds of situations within the game. Finally, there are rules describing how you as a player can use Experience to improve your character.

YOUR CHARACTER is often going to find him-or herself engaged in combat. The rules of combat are more detailed than other aspects of the rule set since it is your character's life that is on the line. If you are not tactical, committed and brave, then there is a risk that the battle will end with the death of you or your companions.

Combat in Symbaroum should be colorful, and there is a lot of room for you and your friends to describe your actions and to immerse yourself in the combat, the attacks and the escapes. The Game Master is there to decide how to realize your ideas and strategies so do not be afraid to get creative.

_**Example**: In order to help illustrate specific rules, we will use the example character Grumpa, the ogre that was created by our imagined player Mira in the first part of The Player's Book. Grumpa the Ogre is a member of the White Dove, a theater company that travels through Davokar towards the high plateau of Karvosti._

_On their way the company faces a band of brutal brigands, crude thugs who would rather steal the possessions of others than risk their own lives in the forest's blight-infested ruins. The company is not interested in handing over their honestly stolen riches and so combat begins. Let us see how it goes for our ogrely heroine in the brawl ..._

### Turn Order

THE CHARACTER with the highest Quickcan choose to either act first or to wait. You may choose to place your Initiative later in the turn order, but once the order is established it cannot be changed. If two persons have the same Quickvalue, then compare Vigilant. If they still share the same value, roll 1020: the highest outcome goes first.

#### COMBAT WITH WEAPONS READY

When combat starts it is important to know whether the combatants have their weapons drawn or not. Also, remember that Long weapons get a Free Attack against one enemy during the first turn of melee combat, provided that the enemy does not have a Long weapon as well.

_**Example:** The brigand has Quick 10, just like Grumpa, but he has Vigilant 11 against Grumpas 9, so he has the initiative. Yet. Grumpa is armed with a staff with the Long quality. One of the brigands approaches Grumpa with a drawn sword, but thanks to having the advantage of reach, Grumpa performs her Free Attack and attacks before the brigand. Then the Initiative goes to the brigand, and after that it is Grumpa's usual turn. In the second turn, Grumpa can no longer take advantage of her long staff, and so the brigand attacks first._

#### SURPRISE

It usually requires a successful [Discreet<-Vigilant] test to surprise someone. If a group tries to surprise another group, instead ofindividual against individual, use the attackers' lowest Discreet modified by the defenders' highest Vigilant. He or she who surprises an enemy is allowed to make one Free Attack against said enemy at the start of the turn. After that, follow the regular turn order, based on the combatants' Quick values, as described above.

If any of the combatants are surprised at the start of combat, they must draw their weapons. All Short weapons can be unsheathed as a Free Action, thanks to their small weight and length. To unsheathe a weapon is otherwise considered a Movement Action. Another option is of course to not draw any weapons and instead choose to use punches and kicks; an individual's or creature's natural weapons are always considered ready and do not have to be drawn or unsheathed.

_**Example:** Another brigand tries to sneak up on Grum pa from behind. Our ogre is in trouble! The sneaking brigand has Discreet 10 and Grumpa has Vigilant 10. Mira rolls 12 and our poor ogre is surprised. This works the same way as with a Long weapon, the enemy can make a Free Attack against Grumpa, and then the turn order continues as usual._

### Actions in Combat

IN COMBAT, your character will kick and fight, slash and stab, parry and dodge. The character does this with his or her two Actions per turn; one Combat Action and one Movement Action. The Combat Action can be replaced with an additional Movement Action, and Movement Actions can be replaced by other kinds of Actions.

Besides Combat and Movement Actions, every combatant may perform Reactive Actions, such as performing Free Attacks and Defense tests. There are also Free Actions, Actions that are either brief or can be made in parallel with other Actions. All Actions, except Reactions, are performed on the character's Initiative. Reactions are performed as it sounds, as a reaction to an enemy's Action or other circumstances.

> #### The Character's Action Economy
> 
> **DURING A TURN A CHARACTER MAY:**
> 
> Perform a Combat Action, such as attacking, perform first aid or use an active ability. The Combat Action can be replaced with an additional Movement Action.
> 
> Perform a Movement Action, such as moving 10 paces, drawing a weapon, reloading a weapon or using an item or an elixir.
> 
> Perform an unlimited amount of Reactions, such as defending itself or performing Free Attacks.
> 
> Perform an unlimited amount of Free Actions, such as giving an order or calling out a warning.
> 
> Stand up from lying on the ground, which either costs a whole turn (two Movement Actions) or one Movement Action if the character succeeds with a Quick test.
 
#### COMBAT ACTION

The most important Action that can be performed in a turn is the attack. It is with this Action that you character attacks its enemies and attempts to harm them with its weapon. The attack is preferably performed with an Active ability, if your character masters such a skill. Passive abilities always act together with active ones.

The attack is made with [Accurate<-Defense]. Note that some abilities can allow you to attack using other Attributes besides Accurate, and calculate Defense using something else than Quick.

A Combat Action does not have to be an attack. To provide first aid to someone or to use any other active ability also counts as a Combat Action.

A Combat Action can be replaced with an additional Movement Action, but not the opposite: a Movement Action cannot be replaced with an additional Combat Action.

_**Example:** When it is Grumpa 's turn to act, she choose to attack using the mystical power Confusion. It's performed with a [Resolute<-Resolute] test. The enemy has Resolute 9 (+1) so Grumpa. who has Resolute 15. must roll 16 or lower (15+ 1) in order to Confuse the enemy. Mira rolls 11 and the enemy stops in his steps, confused. Maybe our ogre has a chance to survive her first combat!_

#### MOVEMENT ACTION

The Movement Action represents a meaningful movement in combat. The Movement Action is done on a character's Initiative. Normally, the exact distance is not of any great importance. What does matter in combat is who can make a melee attack and who can use ranged attacks.

If a more exact distance needs to be calculated, then a Movement Action represents 10 paces (10 meters), but characters who engage an enemy in melee combat naturally stop by the enemy if the distance is shorter than that (in other words, the character does not have to move the full 10 paces). 

**Movement Actions are used to:**
- Reach an enemy and engage it in melee combat.
- Take up a flanking position next to an enemy already fighting an ally.
- Move past an enemy to reach another one that stands further away (enemies that are bypassed may perform a Free Attack).
- Withdraw from melee combat (which allows the enemy to perform a Free Attack against the character). If fighting multiple enemies, then each enemy is allowed a Free Attack.
- Create a clear line of sight to an obscured enemy. 

**Instead of moving, the Movement Action can be used to perform other kinds of Actions:**
- Switch weapons
- Stand up from a prone position (requires a Quick test).
- Drink/apply an elixir to yourself.

 _**Example**: Our dear ogre is considered flanked, since she is standing between two brigands -meaning that the brigands have an Advantage against the big brute. Grumpa solves this with a Movement Action, which triggers a Free Attack from each of her enemies (lucky that Grumpa confused one of them!). The ogre moves around the confused enemy, and receives a Free Attack from the other brigand. After making her move, the ogre has both the brigands in front of her. and is no longer flanked._

#### REACTIONS

Reactions are quick responses or follow-ups to other Actions or circumstances. They can be performed at any time during the turn and are not tied to the character's Initiative. The character can perform as many Reactions as is called for per turn, as long as there are triggers to react to. Reactions can use the effect of passive abilities, but not ofactive ones.

#### FREE ATTACK

There are situations when your character will have the opportunity to make a Free Attack with his or her weapon. This most commonly happens when the character is armed with a Long weapon, when an enemy tries to flee from an ongoing melee combat or when an opponent tries to run past the character in order to reach someone or something behind it. There are also some abilities which trigger Free Attacks under special circumstances.

Free attacks can use the effect of passive abilities but not of active ones, and normally the character can only gain one Free Attack per triggering factor and turn -if two enemies try to withdraw from melee only 1 Free Attack is gained, but if one withdraws and one runs past, the character gains one Free Attack on each.

_**Example:** Let's go back to the Free Attack our ogre Grumpa was allowed to make against one of the brigands at the start of the battle. Grumpa had no abilities that affected her use of the staff, but if she had (like the Polearm Mastery ability) then the passive parts of that ability (e.g. the 1D8 damage at novice level) would have come into play when Grumpa performed her Free Attack._

#### DEFENSE

You are allowed to attempt to defend yourself against any attacks that your character is aware of. The character's Defense is usually based on Quick, then modified by such things as armor qualities and whether or not the character carries a shield.

When a character is attacked, defense is tested as [Defense<-Accurate]. If the test is successful the character has avoided the attack by either parrying or dodging it. If this test fails, the attack hits and deals damage if the weapon's damage value is higher than the outcome of the roll for the character's Armor.

_**Example:** Our brave ogre heroine is relentlessly attacked by brigands and has to defend herself. Luckily enough, Defense is a Reaction, so Grumpa may defend herself an unlimited number of times each turn. Grumpa's Defense is 6[10, -2 for her leather apron and -2 for her Robust trait]. The Game Master tells her that the attacking enemy's Accurate is -1: this is bad since it leaves Grumpa with an effective Defense of5 [6-1]. The attack comes and Mira rolls 9 on 1020 -Grumpa is hit. It is good that Grumpa is an ogre and hence much tougher than most when it comes to withstanding damage._

> #### Make the Combat Come Alive
> 
> How an attack looks depends on the situation and the location where the battle takes place. Maybe the character is swinging an axe and hits its enemy both in the arm and in the stomach, or a crossbow is being fired from the top of a wall and the bolt slams into the chest of its target. It is important to make the attacks come alive for the battle to be perceived as dramatic.

> #### Death test (1D20)
> 
> **1**
> 
> The character's damage looked much worse than it actually was: the character wakes up with 1D4 Toughness left. The character can act the next turn.
> 
> **2-10**
> 
> The character remains at death's threshold.
> 
> **11-19**
> 
> The character is a step closer to death. The third time the roll has this outcome, the character dies.
> 
> **20**
> 
> The character dies, but may say some last harsh words if the player wants to.

### Damage & Healing

DAMAGE LOWERS the victim's Toughness and a creature dies when its Toughness reaches zero unless it is a player character, in which case he or she is regarded as being dying instead. Damage and wounds can be healed in a number of ways, described in this section.

#### TOUGHNESS

The character's Toughnessis equal to his or her value in the Strong Attribute. However, it can never be lower than 10.

#### PAIN THRESHOLD

A character's Pain Threshold is half of its Strong value, rounded up. The actual Strong value is used to calculate this figure, even if it is lower than 10.

When a creature suffers damage that exceeds its Pain Threshold, from a single attack and after Armor has been subtracted from the damage value, one of the following things happens. Note that it is the player who decides between the two, both for the character when it suffers the damage, as well as the enemy if it is the character that inflicts the pain.
- The affected creature is knocked down and has to get up (see Special Actions).
- The one who deals the damage is allowed to perform an immediate Free Attack against the affected creature.

_**Example:** Our ogre Grumpa has Strong 11, and therefore Toughness 11 and Pain Threshold 6. Grumpa fights savagely against two brigands and both brigands manage to land a hit on our heroine. The damage, after Armor. is 7(4+3). Grumpa's Threshold has not been exceeded, since none of these hits dealt 7 damage on its own. It takes a lot for a pair of brigands to bring our robust heroine down. The fight continues!_

Later in the adventure, Grumpa encounters a blight-stricken Aboar. Now the danger is for real, since a corrupted behemoth like that is capable of bringing down even the mightiest warrior. Grumpa is hit by an attack and suffers 8 points of damage after her Armor has been subtracted. This surpasses her Pain Threshold value of 7. and Grum pa's player decides that the ogre falls butt-first into the mud as a consequence of such a splendid hit.

#### DYING CHARACTERS 

Monsters and non-player characters die as soon as their Toughnessreaches o, unless the Game Master wants something else to happen. In any case, the rules for player characters are different.

When a character reaches o Toughnessit collapses and is considered to be dying. At this point, it cannot help itself in any way. Each turn thereafter the player is forced to make a Death Test with m20 on the character's Initiative. This testis repeated until someone else either stabilizes the dying character with an herbal cure, the Medicus ability or mystical healing -or until the player rolls a 1 and wakes up, or a 20 and dies.

_**Example:** It is not easy for Grumpa when the tainted aboar rams the fallen ogre once more and beats her Toughness down to 0. This looks bad! Grumpa is out of the fight and Mira the player is now forced to make a Death Test each turn to see if Grumpa succumbs to her wounds. The turn after Grumpa was brought down Mira rolls a 3, and so the ogre remains at death s threshold. Mira rolls a 13 in turn two, so Grumpa is one step closer to death. Two more rolls like that and she is gone._

#### DEAD PLAYER CHARACTERS

Dead player characters may not remain in the game, but the player who creates a new character may do so using all the Experience accumulated by the last character. This way, the new character does not have to start too far behind the others.

#### HEALING WOUNDS

Healing can happen naturally, by the use of alchemy and medicine or with the help of mystical powers. Performing first aid on a dying person requires the Medicus ability, an herbal cure or powers of healing.
- Natural healing happens at a rate of one (1) point of Toughness per day.
- Alchemical herbal cures heal one (1) point of Toughness immediately.
- The Medicus ability heals 1D4 Toughness, even more when combined with herbal cures.
- Mystical powers, such as Lay on Hands, and the Recovery ability both heal Toughness; see their respective descriptions for details.

### Special Actions

THE CONDITIONS of the combat situation and the weapons of the combatants will affect the course of events. Special rules for line of sight, the use of shields as well as different kinds of advantages are covered in this section.

#### BLIND FIGHTING

To fight blinded is hard, and the same goes for fighting under bad lighting conditions such as in darkness, smoke or thick fog. If both parties in a battle are affected, then no adjustments are needed. Otherwise, the affected party gets two chances to fail its success tests -if the character is affected, the player rolls twice and picks the worst result; if only the enemy is affected the player rolls twice and picks the best result.

#### DISENGAGE FROM MELEE COMBAT

Disengaging from a melee combat is done on the character's Initiative and costs a Movement Action. The enemy is allowed a Free Attack against the character. This also applies to situations when the character is facing multiple opponents, in which case each opponent is allowed a Free Attack against the character when he or she chooses to disengage.

#### USE/APPLY ELIXIR

To use or apply an elixir on either yourself or your equipment counts as a Movement Action. To use or apply it on somebody else counts as a Combat Action.

#### FIRST AID

To perform first aid on a wounded person counts as a Combat Action and requires a herbal cure, the Medicus ability or other healing powers. The effect of first aid is described in Damage & Healing.

#### STAND UP

Fighting while lying down is possible, but not recommended, because each enemy that has engaged the character in close combat gets an Advantage against a prone character. See rules for Advantage below. If the character makes a successful test against Quick it only takes a Movement Action for the character to get back on its feet. Otherwise, it takes an entire turn, meaning that the character cannot perform a Combat Action while getting up.

#### LINE OF SIGHT

Ranged weapons cannot shoot past other combatants, meaning that the shooter (or the mystic) may need to use Movement Actions to maneuver for them to have line of sight. A rule of thumb is that if a shooter or a mystic stands behind an ally so that the targeted enemy is forced to trigger a Free Attack to reach the shooter, then the target is obscured from view by the shooter's ally.

#### SHIELD

Anyone can defend themselves with a shield, providing +1 to Defense.

The use of a shield makes it impossible to use ranged and Heavy weapons and neutralizes the reach advantage gained from a Long weapon, since the wielder must use it in one hand. The buckler is an exception to this, allowing the use ofboth hands, as well as giving the user +1 to Defense.

#### FLANKING

To surround the enemy is an effective combat strategy. If two persons flank an enemy, both of them gain an Advantage against the target. A maximum of four persons can surround a person or creature; any combatant beyond that will be unable to reach the target and can only step forward if one of its allies retreats or goes down.

Terrain and the movement of the combatant decide what is possible to achieve. Doors, corridors and narrow passages can be used to prevent enemies from flanking.

Remember that attempting to move past an enemy triggers a Free Attack. The Free Attack can be avoided if the combatant opts to trade its Combat Action that turn for an additional Movement Action, making it possible to go around the enemy without entering into melee.

> #### Abilities & Special Actions
> 
> Note that there are many abilities that affect the character's capacity to perform Special Actions. For example, an adept in Acrobatics can get up from lying down as a Free Action, provided that he or she succeeds with a Quick test. And the master level of Sixth Sense removes any negative modifications from Blind Fighting which can be used when attacking opponents in the dark.

> #### Combat Map
> 
> It can help to have a map of the battlefield in order to get a better overview of the combat situation. Draw the surrounding area on a piece of paper and mark where everybody stands with an "X" or simple markers or tokens. Even objects and terrain -such as trees, boulders and buildings -should be drawn on the map. Then it quickly becomes much more obvious where the combatants stand, who can shoot, who is flanked and so on. A combat map is even more recommended for battles with many combatants, such as in combat situations where the characters face the same number of enemies as themselves.


#### SURPRISED

To sneak up on an enemy or prepare an ambush is an active Action and requires a successful [Discreet<-Vigilant] test. Attacking an enemy that is unaware of the incoming attack allows the attacker to make a Free Attack in the first turn of combat. Then the combat follows the usual turn order, based on the combatants Quick.

#### ADVANTAGE

Sometimes one side of a melee combat gets an advantage over the other. A character sneaking up on an enemy to attack it from behind has the Advantage. Another situation where you are at an Advantage is when you attack a target lying on the ground or a target that is climbing towards you. To create advantages when fighting on plain and even ground requires the use of Actions, attacks or movements.

If your character has the Advantage in a combat situation, it receives a +2 modification to the relevant Attribute when making a Success test, and its attacks deal 1D4 extra damage.

**The following situations provide advantages:**
- Attacking an enemy that is unaware of the pending attack. For this situation to occur, a successful [Discreet<-Vigilant] test is normally required by the attacker.
- All melee attacks against a flanked enemy counts as providing an Advantage. A target is considered flanked if two enemies stand on opposite sides oftit. It usually takes a Movement Action to get around an enemy and flank it. In the same way a character can use a Movement Action to get away from a flanked position -but with the consequence of receiving a Free Attack from each enemy.
- All melee attacks against an enemy lying down. Note that ranged attacks do not get any advantage from this.
- All attacks against enemies standing on lower ground than the attacker, such as attacking down from a wall against enemies climbing a ladder. This applies to both me lee and ranged attacks.

### Other Important Rules

THE GAME MASTER handles most things regarding problem-solving and social challenges, but here follows a description of the basic idea of how those situations are dealt with. This section also describes how to develop your character. These improvements are made using Experience,which is a reward gained from partaking in and surviving adventures. The Game Master awards the Experience, while the player uses it to improve his or her character.

#### PROBLEM-SOLVING

Problem-solving refers to situations where your character attempts to achieve something that requires dice rolls and Success tests, but which is not a combat-situation: tracking a fleeing enemy, picking a lock, persuading a guard to let you in or researching the answer to a riddle in a library. The Game Master handles most of this; as a player you only have to be ready to describe how your character attempts to solve the problem, and then roll the dice to make the test asked for by the Game Master.

#### SOCIAL CHALLENGES

Social challenges consist ofimportant negotiations, often involving the great and powerful personas, groups and monsters of the game worldt-situations that are unfit for combat and cannot be solved with a mere Persuasive test. In short, the social challenge is solved by your and your friends' roleplaying, where you will have to persuade, deceive and bargain your way to a solution. The Game Master handles the parameters for the social challenge, while you portray your character and together with your fellow players try to carry through a successful negotiation around the gaming table.

Social challenges are often preceded by scenes of problem-solving, where the character gathers information, secrets and rumors that can be used against the one they need to persuade.

#### IMPROVING YOUR CHARACTER

Experienceis awarded by the Game Master after a completed adventure. Experience is traded in for higher levels in the character's abilities, or used to purchase new ones. Purchasing a new ability at novice level costs 10 Experience, to increase from novice to the adept level costs 20 Experience and increasing from adept to master costs 30 Experience.

_**Example:** Grumpa the ogre survives her first adventure and is rewarded with 12 points of Experience. To purchase a new ability at novice level costs 10 Experience, but Mira decides to save her Experience: she already has five novice abilities and wants to increase one of them to adept level._

After another adventure, Grumpa is awarded with an additional 9 points, to a total of 21 Experience. Mira increases one of her abilities to adept level (at a cost of 20 Experience) after which she only has one (1) point of Experience left.
