## Mystical Traditions

IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED that the world does not only consist of matter, and it is obvious to everyone that there are individuals who can manipulate the flows of both material and non-material energies. The use of mystical powers is in no way commonplace, not in Ambria, nor among the barbarians. But it is common enough for many cultures to have formed traditions around it.

THE MYSTICAL TRADITIONS answer questions regarding how these powers are to be understood, how they may be taught as well as in what ways they are meant to be used. They have also worked out ways to avoid or at least lessen the dark side-effects of casting mystical powers and rituals. The powers not only manipulate but also violate the fabric of the world, something which makes the world strike back -in the form of Corruption. That effect can be reduced with the help of the traditions.

Player characters need not belong to or practice any of the traditions to be able to use mystical powers. Mystics without connections to a tradition are often called Untamed and are considered dangerous by their traditionally trained colleagues. Schooled mystics sometimes perceive the independent ones as no better than sorcerers, but mostly regard them as their less fortunate and less successful cousins.

### Theurgy

THEURGY IS NOWADAYS understood as the teachings of the mystical force that radiates from the sun and which burns at the heart of the human spirit. Its powers are only found among the most loyal worshipers of the light: the chosen champions of Prios. The theurgs are considered the emissaries of Prios in the world of the living, and their burden is truly a great one. They lead the faithful in prayer, thereby guiding the sun through the darkness of the underworld each night. And their passion keeps the heavenly light from fading; without their strenuous work the ailing Sun God would surely die and the world would plunge into The Eternal Night.

Theurgy is an ancient tradition, first developed by the priesthoods devoted to the Old Gods. It is disputed among scholars and the learned whether witchcraft is older than theurgy or if it is the other way around. Either way, the golden age of theurgy is now. Ever since Prios earned himself the devotion and faith of most Ambrians, the bearers of the tradition have thrived. It is not important to them which of the traditions came first and which is the oldest. As far as the theurgs are concerned, the worshiping of moss and veneration of trees are unworthy of mankind's holy spirit, and most consider witchcraft to be a path that leads only to decay and sorcery. They regard wizardry -the mystical order built on the foundation of older theurgy -in much the same way, as a truly godless and morally questionable practice.

#### THE TITLES OF THEURGY

The titles within the tradition of theurgy are intertwined with the Church of Prios, since theurgs are the defenders of the Church, chosen by Sun God himself. Obedience to one's elders is both highly regarded and enforced, and the punishments for disobedience are severe. Lowest in rank are the initiates, who assist and are tutored by the Church's Brothers and Sisters, who in turn serve under the elder theurgs, called Fathers or Mothers. Within the organization of the Sun Church there are also priests who have not been granted the God-given powers of the theurgs, and they are called liturgs.

#### POWERS

The blessings and curses of theurgy include Anathema, Blessed Shield, Holy Aura, Inherit Wound, Lay on Hands, Levitate, Prios' Burning Glass, True Form, Unnoticeable and Witch Hammer.

#### RITUALS

The rituals of theurgy, often performed as religious ceremonies, are Command Confession, Exorcism, Heretic's Trail, Holy Smoke, Judging Bonds, Oracle, Patron Saint, Purging Fire and Sanctifying Rite.

#### CORRUPTION

The theurgs of Prios teach that Corruption occurs when nature is allowed to grow without being cultivated and tamed. The Corruption thrives in the wild, in chaos, that which is uncontrolled by humans -and in their encounters with Davokar they seem to find all the evidence needed to support this interpretation of the world order.

Every devotee of Prios must accept the threat of Corruption and keep their inner flame burning despite the risk of taint; just as the Lightbringer Ofelya Attio is said to have proclaimed while standing at the threshold of the Dark Lords' stronghold: "Fire shall with fire be fought, darkness shall with darkness be vanquished!"

### Sorcery

THE LEGENDS ARE teeming with sorcerers: mystics who draw their power from musty wellsprings or gain their corrupt gifts from creatures of evil. It is harder to find them in the real world, but those who know how to read the Shadows can sense their presence or see traces of their tainted work. Korinthia' s people faced the undead servants of the Dark Lords during The Great War, and while the Dark Lords perished, their parasitic powers continued to drain the life out of Alberetor, forcing the Ambrians to flee north. There they instead faced the blighted creatures oftDavokar, born from another kind of evil that festers in the fallen ruins of Symbaroum.

Sorcery is the mystical tradition that comprises powers and rituals fueled by Corruption and taint, whose usage provides power in the short run, but corrodes the mystic's body and soul in the long run. Theurgs active among the Twilight Friars gather rituals of sorcery as well as blight-stricken artifacts in an attempt to understand this new, dark enemy. Within their monastery in the Titans, it is said that the Black Cloaks hide dark vaults oozing with corruptive energies and echoing with the lamentations of the poor, tainted souls kept there for study.

#### POWERS

The incantations of Sorceryinclude Bend Will, Curse, Larvae Boil, Revenant Strike and Unholy Aura.

#### RITUALS

The sacrificial practices of the dark arts include such rituals as Desecrating Rite, Enslave, Exchange Shadow and Possess.

#### CORRUPTION

In the view of the sorcerer the world is dying or already dead, and Corruption is but one of many symptoms of its irredeemable state. To fight Corruption is like pretending that death does not exist. Better to know it, and learn how to understand and use it as much as possible before everything meets its fated end.

To walk side by side with darkness is a precarious act of balance, to say the least. Not to give in to darkness is the key, for doing so would surely mean being completely devoured. Wise sorcerers accept Corruption, and exploit it, while still keeping a distance from its cold embrace, for as long as they possibly can.

### Witchcraft

THE WITCHES' WORLD is composed of winds, blood and all things growing, together forming the three hazardous paths a witch has to wander: the white path where the wind wails and spirits howl; the red path of the slow-running blood; and the green path, overgrown by thickets and roots. According to the mythology of the witches, there are places where these three paths converge, such as the cliff oftKarvosti deep within Davokar.

Witchcraft is believed to be the oldest and most deeply rooted of the traditions. Some tutors at Ordo Magica even claim that witchcraft -despite its primitive flaws -forms the basis oftheurgy, and because of this, both theurgs and wizards have the wise witches of old to thank for understanding the fundamental principles of magic.

#### THE TITLES OF WITCHCRAFT

Witches believe in independence, thus they are watchful of titles and hierarchal structures. The harsh living conditions of Davokar have resulted in each barbarian village housing a witch, and every witch is expected to have a helper (an apprentice). Furthermore, within each clan there is a witches' node supervised by a Keeper, often called a Hex Mistress by southern scholars. All nodes convene at Karvosti, where the High Chieftain is advised by the Huldra, the foremost of all witches, whom outsiders generally call the Arch Witch.

#### POWERS

The chants of the witches include Bend Will, Curse, Entangling Vines, Inherit Wound, Larvae Boil, Lay on Hands, Maltransformation, Nature's Embrace, ShapeshifHng and Storm Arrow.

#### RITUALS

The rituals of witchcraft are often performed as dances and include Blood Bond, Borrow Beast, Familiar, Nature'sLullaby, Necromancy, Oracle, Quick Growth, Turn Weather and Witch Circle.

#### CORRUPTION

For practitioners of witchcraft Corruption is viewed as nature's way of seeking balance; what the witch does to the world strikes back against him or her. The Corruption must be weighed against the necessity of what the witch is about to do and be handled accordingly. Some witches will choose to sacrifice themselves to the Corruption in order to save their people; such is the fate of a witch according to the demands of life in the gloom oftDavokar.

### Wizardry

THE POWERS OF WIZARDRY come from disciplined studies into the fundamental laws of nature, and from insights regarding how these laws can be used and controlled by sheer will and reason. It is a strenuous education, even without the boring everyday tasks that the novices must perform for their masters. Only half of those who begin their studies with Ordo Magica see them through, but those who prevail are rewarded with a deep understanding of the mysteries of wizardry.

Wizardry grew out of early forms oftheurgy, in a time when the people of Alberetor still worshipped a pantheon of gods. Philosophers and scholars started to renounce the metaphysical ideas of the priesthood, instead regarding the laws of nature as independent from the machinations of deities. To the founders of Wizardry, the Old Gods were seen as the creators of the world, but not its shepherds. Instead the world is regarded as being profoundly magical and not in need of any Gods to function. Nor is the world meant to be worshiped, merely understood -and used.

#### THE TITLES OF ORDO MAGICA

The titles ofWizardry are closely linked to the competence and function, as well as the status, of the individual. The list of a novice's duties is a long one, and the commitments of the adept wizard are considerable, though their new title comes with a touch of authority and privilege. An adept who is experienced enough to teach carries the title Magistrate.

The Masters often have a specific area of expertise, and the few obligations they have can usually be delegated to a novice or adept under their rule. Each order chapter (commonly called "Wizards' guild") is governed by a Chapter Master, who represents Ordo Magica when dealing with local authorities. Ordo Magica as a whole is headed by the Grand Master, stationed at the chapter in Agrella.

The title of Arch Mage is no longer in use. Before The Great War the Grand Master of the organization was chosen from within the circle of Arch Mages. But since all Arch Mages perished in the war, the Grand Master is instead chosen by, and often from among, the acting Chapter Masters.

#### POWERS

The spells of wizardry include Anathema, Bend Will, Brimstone Cascade, Confusion, Flame Wall, Illusionary Correction, Levitate, Mind Throw, True Formand Unnoticeable.

#### RITUALS

The catalogue of wizards' rituals covers Clairvoyance, False Terrain, Flaming Servant, Illusion, Magic Circle, Sanctum, Seven-league Stride, Soul Stone, Tale ofAshesand Telepathic Interrogation.

#### CORRUPTION

According to Ordo Magica, Corruption is largely misunderstood, thanks to the sermons ofhot-headed theurgs and the fairy tales of witches. It all comes down to a regulated response; a reaction that appears when a mystic uses his or her power to affect nature. This is not that different from what happens when someone jumps off the stern of a boat, simultaneously pushing the boat forward with the same amount of force that goes into the jump. If the jumper is reckless, he will drop into the water; if the jumper is careful, he will land on the dock with dry shoes.

### Independent Mystics

PARTICULARLY GIFTED INDIVIDUALS have always been able to bend and break seemingly inescapable laws of nature, and many scholars claim that it was through coalitions of such independent, or untamed, mystics that the traditions first arose. Whether this is true or not, there occasionally are individuals who either choose or are forced to study on their own, or in smaller groups.

Independent Mystics are not burdened with the theories of the traditions, which give them more freedom in their choice of powers. However, they are also much more vulnerable to Corruption. Many untamed mystics tend to evolve their own understanding of the world and come to espouse theories that contradict those of the established traditions.

#### POWERS

The player may pick any mystical power for his or her independent mystic.

#### RITUALS

Independent mystics rarely learn rituals, but when they do the chosen rituals tend to be highly personal, without regard for traditional restrictions.

#### CORRUPTION

The gift of freedom is double-edged and darkness is drawn to the gifted as envy to those with talent. The power of Corruption cuts deep and must be kept under control; many a free mystic has accepted the darkness although it truly is a kiss of death.

> ##### The Myth of Pure Magic
> Within all traditions there is a myth of the Pure Magic, the undefiled miracle. In different versions it tells about a time when the world was unspoiled and when the use of mystical powers yielded no Corruption. Then something happened. Evil entered the world and with it came the blight. Some mystics dream about recreating the pure magic of yore by healing the wounds of the world, by expelling evil, by slaying the World Serpent or reclaiming the long lost arch magic. However, most Mystics accept Corruption as a part of their trade and just something to be dealt with.
