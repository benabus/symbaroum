## Races

THERE ARE LOTS of strange creatures in Ambria, and even stranger life forms in the depths of Davokar. However, when creating a character with the basic ruleset, the player is limited to choosing from the races described in this chapter; races whose representatives are relatively numerous and live in or near Ambria's many towns and settlements.

### Human

ACCORDING TO THE SCHOLARS of Ordo Magica, the people of Ambria and Davokar are descendants of the same tribe, although the barbarians and the Queen's Folk hardly consider themselves so closely related. Queen Korinthia's claim to Ambria, the land south of Davokar forest, is motivated by her ancestral connection to the region, and even the most novice of Ambrian linguists can explain in what ways the gibbering speech of the barbarians and the melodious tongue of the Queen's Folk are similar. More disputed are claims saying that the two peoples originate from the same stem, rooted in the old and long forgotten empire ofSymbaroum whose ruins are hidden deep within Davokar.

Whatever the case, there are significant differences between the two peoples in a cultural sense. The Ambrians abandoned their blighted homeland Alberetor twenty years ago, to settle down in the well-preserved ruins oftLindaros. On their journey they brought along their architecture, knowledge, economic system and social hierarchies. Thanks to its discipline the Ambrian army outmatches the barbarian clan warriors when they meet in the open fields, but in the woods where the skill of the individual becomes a decisive factor they are more evenly matched. That, coupled with the advantage of having greater local knowledge, has so far kept the Ambrians from entering very deep into the forest -with the exception of treasure-hunters, religious fanatics searching for lost sun temples and free settlers hoping to escape the Queen's control.

Since the days of old, the barbarians have been ruled by chieftains, but have enjoyed much greater independence and freedom compared to the chastened crofters and peasants in the south. Nor do the barbarian leaders seek to enforce a strict or rigid way oflife upon their subjects. The witches, the spiritual leaders among the barbarians, rule with a light hand in the form of taboos and general rules -revere nature, never abuse it and avoid the darker parts of the forest. The clans lead their lives independent from one another, with the occasional exception of skirmishes over resources in the border regions. By tradition, the clan leaders answer to the High Chieftain on the plateau oftKarvosti, but he is in reality more of an arbitrator between feuding clans than a strong ruler. However, the High Chieftain is expected to lead the united barbarians to repel any invaders, particularly the Ambrians, if it ever comes to open war.

This possibility, a united barbarian resistance commanded by the High Chieftain, gives the Queen and her advisors nightmares, and would explain why the Ambrians officially are so cautious regarding Davokar. Since the battle in Year 10, when Korinthia's troops attacked and destroyed Haloban and his Jezites, only the Templars serving the Sun Church have made any outright attacks against barbarian settlements. Most infamous is their assault on Karvosti in Year 16 when they attempted to seize the plateau with force of arms -an attempt which ended in a discouraging defeat.

#### AMBRIAN TRAITS

Characters of the Queen's Folk can choose either the Contacts or the Privileged trait.

#### AMBRIAN NAMES

Female Ambrian names usually end with-a while the male names end with -o, but there are many exceptions since their native kingdom was so extensive. One distinct exception is that the names of most Ambrian nobles ends in -gai, -goi or -mei. The use of the letter "x" is uncommon but existing and the letter "j" is replaced by the letter "i" in almost every case. The vowels e and i are used frequently.
- **Male Ambrian names:** Aro, Beremo, Demeon, Edogai, Gadramei, lasogoi, Jomilo, Karlio, Malliano, Peonio.
- **Female Ambrian names:** Abesina, Elindra, Elionara, Levia, Mehira, Ordelia, Revina, Suria, Variol, Vidina.

#### BARBARIAN TRAITS

Characters ofbarbarian heritage can choose either the Contacts or the Bushcra. trait.

#### BARBARIAN NAMES

Just like the Ambrians, barbarian female names usually end with -a, while male names tend to end with-mar, -mon or-mer. It is customary that every other letter is a consonant and a vowel; double vowels are common, while double consonants are almost never used. Like the Ambrians, barbarians tend not to use the letter "j", instead changing it to "y". The greatest difference between the two people is the barbarians' love for the vowels a, o and u.
- **Male barbarian names:** Adelar, Gadramon, Haloban, Konarad, Lothar, Odaban, Rabaiamon, Taran, Tharaban, Vikomer.
- **Female barbarian names:** Adela, Aloeta, Eferneya, Elmea, Elda, Galoma, Horosa, Karona, Verama, Yagaba.



### Changeling

THAT THE ELVES sometimes steal a human child from its crib and place a changeling in its stead has been known amongst the barbarians for as long as the witches can remember. Since the arrival of the Ambrians, changelings have started to emerge among them as well. While a rare occurrence, it is still a traumatic experience for every family affected. It is unknown what exact purpose the elves have for doing this, but Ordo Magica's catalogue of known cases in Ambria implies that children have been taken throughout the entire population, literally from both high and low.

A changeling looks human during childhood and starts to develop more elf-like features in their adolescent years, though without ever becoming an elf in the true sense of the word. A changeling reaches adulthood at approximately the same age as a human; the changeling then continues to live a long life but apparently without taking any further steps in the life cycle of the elves. This has made some scholars develop theories stating that changelings are a race of their own, created by elven magic. Others claim that changelings indeed are elf-spawn but that their natural life cycle has been truncated in some mystical way by growing up among humans.

A changeling's lot in life is usually a hard one, since few of them are allowed to stay with their families when their true nature has been revealed. Changelings are sometimes taken in by witches or wizards to serve as assistants, but most of them end up on the street where they have to fend for themselves as best they can. Exiled from human society, the changeling wanders a long and lonely road, often bitter and dark minded, in other cases frivolous and indifferent to the hardship of others.

#### CHANGELING TRAITS

All changelings have the Long-lived trait and most also have the Shapeshifter trait (costs as an ability).

#### CHANGELING NAMES

Some changelings chose elven names when they are thrown out into the street or left in the forest, maybe in an attempt to reclaim a lost identity. Others -like the infamous gutter mage Grimorio Abramelin in Yndaros -take a new and often bombastic name as a defiant gesture or an expression ofindependence.
- **Changeling male names:** Aka, Ardri, Eneano, Feon, Ganderald, Goriol, Ibliglin, Kalfu, Radomaramei, Sinue.
- **Changeling female names:** Bekora, Danive, Yeloena, Elorinda, Hineua, Kinlegelana, Riamata, Roha, Seanua, Varaneia.

### Ogre

OGRES ARE SOLITARY and odd creatures that come wandering out of the depths of Davokar, fully grown but devoid of memories and with no sense of identity. It is up to the humans or goblins who eventually take them in to give them a name and teach them the ways of the world.

The tales told of ogres vary from being hilarious through mystical to horrific. What is known is that the witches oftDavokar sometimes take ogres under their wings and raise them to be guards and servants. Explorers have also reported that an Ambrian outpost near the Black Pitch Mire has adopted an ogre called Armstout and the soldiers there have the giant dig ditches, lift heavy equipment and draw the plow from time to time. A similar phenomenon is the ogres that are snatched by goblin gangs in the slums oftYndaros to serve as heavy-handed enforcers.

In southern Davokar they tell of the companions Deterror and Vitrona, the latter a skillful scout employed by the witches and the former a huge ogre and the scout's best friend. Word of the duo has also reached Thistle Hold where they have become the subjects of a series of popular songs, telling about their adventures in the ruins of Symbaroum.

#### OGRE TRAITS

All ogres have the Long-lived and Pariahtraits. Most have the Robust trait as well (costs as an ability).

#### OGRE NAMES

Ogres seem to lack any given names and are therefore nicknamed by people around them. These nicknames often allude to the ogres' size or the taciturn calm that many mistake for stupidity. Ordo Magica speculates that such lonesome creatures actually have no use for proper names -the ogre knows who it is and that is enough.
- **Ogre names:** Bauta, Ugly, Angry, Odd, Gawky, Heavy, Big Brute, Roughneck, Freak, Oaf, Ox, Rageor.


### Goblin

LITTLE IS KNOWN about the origin of goblins, but their presence in the southern outskirts oftDavokar is quite obvious. The tribe that left the darkness of Davokar to settle down close to Thistle Hold swarms and makes such a racket that they have made themselves quite unpopular among the town's human populace. Their fiery temperament and strange ways of socializing have contributed to the disapproval: "Hide the Boot", "Tame the Ogre", "Trim the Thistle", "Tighten the Temple" and "Want a Smack, Molok?" are party games that outsiders are reluctant to even watch.

The life of a goblin is short -a goblin is considered a youngster at the age of five, adult at ten and an elder at the age of twenty. To meet a thirty-year-old goblin is a rarity, as most of them voluntarily return to seek a lonesome death in Davokar before then. Meeting one who is forty is all but unheard of.

The only reason why goblins are tolerated in Thistle Hold is that they are practical when it comes to doing dirty work like draining marshes, emptying latrines and flailing about on scaffoldings. Thanks to that, a gibbering horde of sinewy goblins flows into the town every morning to work hard with a number of heavy, dangerous or thankless tasks. Come nightfall, they are once again driven away, and a bunch of uncharacteristically silent goblins march back to their beds in simple huts of straw and clay.

Some goblins stray from this pattern, mainly treasure-hunters and goblins employed in the households of wealthy individuals in Thistle Hold. A dozen or so goblin younglings can also be found in the convent school in the capital city, where a handful of extremely patient monks have committed themselves to save whatever soul resides inside the wild whelps. The most renowned goblin to represent both of these phenomena is Garm Wormwriggler, brought up at the convent school to later become a successful treasure-hunter.

#### GOBLIN TRAITS

All goblins have both the Short-lived and Pariah traits. Most have the Survival Instinct trait as well {costs as an ability).

#### GOBLIN NAMES

Goblin names are varied and it is hard to see any clear naming conventions. It is also common for goblins to change their names or add a syllable depending on what they experience in life. If one were to attempt to point out something general regarding their names, it would be that the length of the names usually goes hand-in-hand with the bearer's rank -the longer the name, the higher the status within the tribe.
- **Goblin male names:** Alfbolg, Barra, Goltas, Illefons, Ler, Rosti, Shigg, Tengel, UL
- **Goblin female names:** Aa, Fosa, Guhula, Hugalea, Tulga, Udelia, Ufa, Wamba, Yla, Yppa.
