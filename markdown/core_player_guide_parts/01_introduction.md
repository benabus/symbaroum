## Introduction

AS THE NAME SUGGESTS, this part of the book is primarily meant for the players of Symbaroum. The Game Master will have to be familiar with the rules as well, but the content of this section mainly focuses on how to create a character and the rules that the players will use while playing the game.

THIS FIRST CHAPTER begins with a section describing what aspects of roleplaying are meant to be handled by the players, followed by an introduction to the process of creating a character. The eight chapters that come thereafter explain the different parts of character creation in depth from Attributes and Abilities to what equipment a character has from the start.

The last chapter in the Player's Guide describes the players' ruleset. There you can learn how combat works, how to handle wounds and healing, as well as how to improve a character and develop its abilities using the Experience gained from completing adventures.

In this book you will hopefully find all of the tools needed in order to create colorful characters and to let them make a name for themselves among Ambrians and barbarians. If you, for any reason, would like to deviate from or add to the rules presented below -feel free to bring it up for discussion with your gaming group. Your character is your conduit and avatar in the setting of Symbaroum, so it is vitally important that you make it your own and create it just the way you want it.

### Role of the Player

THE PLAYERS AND the Game Master have an equal responsibility for the shared experience, even if their roles are a bit different when playing. Below you will find suggestions regarding what aspects of the game session the players should take the main responsibility for. It is entirely up to you and your group if you wish to deviate from what is said below, in which case the suggestions may serve as a guideline for your discussions and decisions.

#### CREATING CHARACTERS

The number of players in a gaming group preferably ranges between two and four, though it is fully possible to play with only one player and a Game Master. The number of players aside, each player is in control of one character through which he or she experiences and interacts with the game world.

Before you create your character it might be a good idea to ask the Game Master about the upcoming adventure or the campaign: what kind of character would be appropriate to play? You should also talk with the other players in the group. What are they playing and in what way can the characters complement each other?

#### THE CHARACTER'S GOAL

Establish at least one distinct goal for your character -something that he or she wants to achieve, defend or avoid. The goal(s) will change over time as the character evolves but there should always be at least one clear goal that helps in propelling the game forward.

As a guideline, it can be said that some goals are inappropriate for characters and gaming groups. Goals that are an inevitable effect of playing and therefore lack dramatic potential fall into this category -for instance, "to get better equipment", "to get more money", "to gain more Experience" and "to have more and better abilities". You will find examples of more suitable goals in the box The Character's Goal.

> ##### The Character's Goal
>
> - Restore your family's honor
> - Become the leader of a guild, chapter or an organization
> - Become the acknowledged master of a particular area of expertise
> - Take revenge on a person or a creature
> - Save a person from captivity
> - Find a missing person
> - Lift a curse that has fallen on the character or someone else
> - Retrieve a lost heirloom or weapon

#### THE GROUP'S GOAL

It is good for the group to share a common goal besides the characters' personal ones. Discuss with the other players what your group would like to accomplish, in the short or the long run. Grander goals will probably be more constant over time, while lesser ones may come to change and be replaced as the game moves forward.

> ##### The Group's Goal
>
>- Lead a large group of people to safety
>- Establish an organization together
>- Establish a base for the group
>- Obtain more land, ships or wagons
>- Gain control of a specific location
>- Overthrow a leader
>- Become a force to be reckoned with in a specific location or in a particular area of expertise
>- Remove a serious and known threat towards the group
>- Lift a curse
>- Form an alliance with another faction in the area
>- Mediate peace between two fighting parties
>- Fulfill a prophecy
>- Find a legendary artifact or site

#### BRING THE CHARACTER TO LIFE

Describe your character to the group so that everybody gets a sense of who he or she is. Play and act as if you were there, experiencing it all, and trying to achieve the character's goals. When things happen, react to them. Describe what your character wants to do and the Game Master will explain what is needed for that to succeed.

#### INITIATE SCENES

You should not be afraid to initiate things, to let your character respond to and interact with the game world. Describe your intentions and the Game Master will decide what you need to do in order to make it happen. Sometimes the Game Master will turn your initiative into a challenge, for you or for the entire group.

#### DEVELOP YOUR CHARACTER

Allow your character to change as an effect of what he or she experiences and what happens in the game world -just as Frodo and Bilbo are changed by their adventures. Depending on what he or she has to suffer, it is possible for a character to change anything from beliefs and goals to appearance and the focus of its abilities. Between game sessions you can use the Experience that your character has gained to increase abilities that correspond to what challenges he or she has faced, or acquire new abilities that mirror the character's hardearned experiences.

#### DESCRIBE FUTURE PLANS

When a game session ends, describe what your character intends to do next, so the Game Master can prepare for it. Should the session instead mark the end of an entire adventure, describe what your player character will do until the start of the next adventure.

### How to Create a Character

RULESWISE, YOUR CHARACTER is defined by some numbers and notes on a character sheet. The numbers indicate what your character is good at, what abilities and powers it has and how much damage its weapons can inflict on an enemy. The notes can describe what kind of equipment the character carries, what its goals are and what kind of personality it has.

Where you get your inspiration from when creating a character may vary, but it often comes from movies, TV-shows and books. Some may only need the texts and pictures within this book, or they may use their ordinary selves as a starting point for building their character. In the end the source of inspiration is irrelevant, but your character has to feel alive, has to have goals and a personality that belongs in the setting ofSymbaroum. If you manage to create that, then acting as the character should be both fun and easy.

The easiest way to create a character is to pick an archetype (Warrior, Mystic or Rogue), one of its associated occupations (Berserker, Witch or Treasure Hunter, for example) and follow the recommendations regarding Attributes, Race, Abilities and so on. That way you will be ready to play in no time.

However, there is nothing that stops you from creating a character entirely from scratch, without regard to archetypes and occupations, just the way you want it in terms of Attributes and powers. The archetypes and their respective occupations are only meant to inspire and to offer a quick and easy way into the game and the setting.

#### ARCHETYPES (PAGE 82)

The three archetypal backgrounds presented Warrior, Mystic, Rogue -cover the most common roles for combat and problem-solving found in a group of adventurers. A balanced group contains representatives from all three of these archetypes, which means that the group can handle different types of challenges. This kind of composition also gives each character a greater chance ofbeing in the spotlight at some point during each game session.

Warriors are typically heavily armored and armed fighters who excel in melee combat. Many Warriors are natural leaders that can command and assist their fellow adventurers on the battlefield. Mystics are a diverse lot and can act as a scorcher of enemies or as a healer of allies in battle. The Mystics are often skilled problem-solvers as well, many times thanks to their access to mystical rituals. The Rogue is an agile and cunning combatant, whether fighting from a distance or in close quarters. Rogues are also skillful problem-solvers, especially when it comes to practical or socially oriented challenges.

Each archetype is further exemplified by a number of occupations -a Rogue may for example be a Treasure-Hunter, a Ranger or a Charlatan. In other words, the occupations are suggestions of different kinds of vocations which bring life and variation to the characters.

_**Example:** Let us follow the player Mira as she creates a character. Mira decides to play a mystic of some kind, but doesn't want to start as any of the occupations described as part of the archetype. She therefore writes Mystic under "Archetype" on her character sheet and continues her character's creation with an open mind._

#### ATTRIBUTES (PAGE 100)

Numerically a character is defined by his or her Attributes, eight values that every creature has, but at varying levels: Accurate, Cunning, Discreet, Persuasive, Quick, Resolute, Strong and Vigilant.

These Attributes can be interpreted as talents, skills and interests that the character has acquired so far during his or her lifetime, and correspond to all challenges the character may face in the game. When a character attempts to achieve something of importance within the game world, the player rolls a 20-sided die, called a 020, and compares the result with the value of one of the Attributes. The test is successful if the outcome of the dice roll is equal to or lower than the Attribute value. In other words: the higher the number a character has in an Attribute, the better.

A central part of character creation is to decide which of the Attributes are important and which are less so. Choosing Abilities will help you in that decision, since abilities are often based on certain Attributes, and therefore indicate what Attributes the player should put most emphasis on.

There are two ways to determine a character's Attributes:

- **Typical distribution:** Distribute the values 5, 7, 9, 10, 10, 11, 13, 15 among the character's Attributes. If the player wishes, he or she may then transfer points between the Attributes. Only one attribute value may be as high as 15 and none can be higher than 15 or lower than 5.
- **Point Buy:** Distribute 80 points among the eight Attributes. Only one attribute value may be as high as 15 and none can be higher than 15 or lower than 5.

_**Example:** Mira places 15 in Resolute, since it's an important Attribute for Mystics. She then places the rest of the values like so:Accurate 10, Cunning 13, Discreet 5, Persuasive 7. Quick 11, Strong 10 and Vigilant 9. These values can be changed and moved later on as the character starts to take shape._

#### RACE (PAGE 102)

There are many and varied creatures in Ambria and Davokar, but the races available to players when they create their characters are changeling, human, ogre and goblin. Humans are further divided into two subgroups: Ambrians and barbarians.

_**Example:** Mira likes ogres; those hulking loners of unknown origin. On the surface they may seem more suited to be Warriors than Mystics, but Mira is not bothered by that. She writes ogre under Race on her character sheet. She also makes some changes in her Attributes. She imagines her character to be tall and wiry, if not massive as a troll, so she changes Strong to 11 and Quick to 10._

#### ABILITIES (PAGE 112)

Abilities cover the talents and special skills which give the character more alternatives in combat or when solving a problem. The Abilities are divided into three levels of expertise, from Novice through Adept to Master. A new character most often starts with two abilities or powers at novice level and one at adept level, but you may instead choose to start with five abilities at novice level and none at adept level. Gaming groups that would rather have more experienced characters right from the start can of course decide on another starting level.

_**Example:** Since Mira's character is an ogre she first decides to take the Robust trait at novice level. She does not have to select that trait, but it somehow feels right. To make her character less one-dimensional Mira decides to take five abilities at novice level, rather than two at novice level and one at adept level. After picking Robust Mira has four more to choose. When she is done browsing the abilities Mira picks Mystical Power (Confusion), Ritualist (the Telepathic Interrogationritual), Natural Warrior and Recovery._

#### MYSTICAL TRADITIONS (PAGE 126)

Any character can learn to use mystical powers and rituals, but for those who intend to use them frequently it is wise to learn the theory and practice of some mystical tradition. The reason for this is Corruption. When Mystics make use of their powers and rituals, their bodies and Shadows (see below) are tainted by corruption, which one day may lead to ruin.

The Mystics of the Queen's folk are the cunning wizards of Ordo Magica (the Wizardry ability) and the theurgs predominantly found within the Church of Prios (the Theurgyability}. The barbarian witches wield a much older, more natural, magic, shunned by the southerners but highly regarded by the barbarians and their chieftains (the Witchcraft ability). Sorcerers (the Sorceryability) are desperate and power-hungry mystics that instead of trying to avoid corruption, embrace it and use its tainting powers for their own nefarious purposes.

Again, a character does not have to belong to any of these traditions to learn individual mystical powers. However, the mystic who decides to go that way should take heed, and must be prepared to face the inevitable corruption alone.

_**Example:** Mira has decided that her player character should only partially rely on her mystical powers and does not want the ogre to belong to any tradition. She therefore disregards the traditions and keeps the creation points that she already has placed in Natural Warrior. That way her ogre becomes more diverse rather than a purebred mystic._

#### SHADOW

Every creature and object in the game world has a Shadow, an expression ofits spiritual alliances or its innermost essence. The Shadow indicates to which of the three primal principles a character has the strongest bond (to the discipline of civilization, the wildness of nature or the corruption of darkness), whether the character knows about this bond or not.

Characters can learn to see the Shadow of other creatures by using abilities like Witchsightor rituals like Holy Smoke. Creatures that are close to nature have shadows that range in the colors of green, red or white, while the shadows of civilized people tend to appear in gold, silver or copper. Many who dwell in the southern parts of Davokar or in northern Ambria are of a mixed nature and their shadows can therefore consist of a combination of colors. The shadows of true blight beasts are abysmally black, while a corrupted creature of nature is revealed by sickly spots on green, red with streaks of rust or with ashen grey among the white. In the case of corrupted creatures of civilization the shadows tend to be chipped gold, blackened silver or corroded copper. A character's Shadow is closely connected with the character's level of Corruption, a circumstance that Mystics should be extra aware of.

_**Example:** Mira provides her ogre with a white shadow, as she feels it fits the idea of a spiritual side to the solitary giant. She describes the Shadow as "white as morning mists over the meres of Davokar: Trailing flakes of ash can occasionally be seen within the mist. as a sign of the ogre's dawning corruption. The ogre gets one (1) permanent Corruption for its ritual and another one (1) for its Confusion power. Mira writes down 2 points of permanent Corruption on her character sheet._

#### EQUIPMENT (PAGE 148)

__Table 4: Starting Equipment__
| ABILITY OR POWER  | STARTING EQUIPMENT
|-------------------|---------------------
| Man-at-arms       | Medium armor
| Marksman          | Crossbow or bow
| Polearm Mastery   | Spear
| Shield Fighter    | Shield
| Steel Throw       | One throwing weapon
| Twin Attack       | One single-handed weapon (novice), two single-handed weapons (adept)
| Two-handed Force  | One heavy weapon
| Witchhammer       | One single-handed weapon

A character's starting equipment, weapons and money are decided by its archetype or by abilities and powers picked by the player.

All characters start with camping gear consisting of a sleeping roll, cooking equipment and firewood. Trinkets suited to the character's backstory may be added at no cost: a deck of cards, pipe and tobacco, fishing rod and a case of bait, a signal horn or the like are welcomed since they make the character come alive. Memorabilia like a lock of hair from a lover, a wooden figurine from a deceased relative or an embroidered handkerchief as the only clue to the murderer of the character's father really do enrich the history of a character. Abilities that are based on Cunning (like Alchemy, Beast Lore, Loremaster, Poisoner and Tactician) are likely accompanied by impressive tomes and well-thumbed scrolls regarding the topic in question.

When it comes to starting weapons, a character receives the weapon or weapons associated with a specific ability for free, as well as a dagger. Should a character lack abilities or powers that are based on weaponry, then he or she may instead start with any of the following combinations:
- a sturdy staff and a dagger
- a single-handed weapon and a dagger
- a ranged weapon and a dagger

Other than weapons, a character starts with an ordinary light armor. If a player should want heavier armor, then he or she has to purchase it with the character's starting funds. It may be wise to purchase armor with the Flexible quality, should you be able to afford it: Mystics can buy a witch gown, a wizard's cloak or a priest robe.

#### MONEY

The character starts with 5 thaler in its purse, unless any of its traits say differently. The player can use these thaler to purchase additional weapons, armor and equipment.

The primary currency used in Ambria consists of shillings and ortegs, besides the thaler. Ten ortegs makes one shilling and ten shillings makes one thaler. For an orteg, you can afford common quality living for a day in the countryside, while an equal standard in a city or a town costs a shilling. Tools, weapons and armor usually cost one thaler or more.

_**Example:** Since Mira's ogre has the Pariah trait, she doesn't start with much more than the basic equipment. The ogre gets a club as a weapon, as well as a dagger for eating and a leather apron for light armor. Mira writes down 5 shillings in the ogre's purse, but adds a flute to the equipment list, which she thinks that the ogre should have. On the flute the ogre is going to play sad tunes, their origin unknown even to the ogre herself._

#### PERSONALITY

Fill your character with details that will help to breathe life into the numbers. The character will of course need a name and a detailed background, maybe even a quote that captures its way of speaking and expressing itself. Decide on at least one personal goal for the character, as well as a goal for the whole group, so that the characters have something in common to fight for when the game starts.

_**Example:** An ogre should have a rough name, given to her by the people she has spent time with. After some consideration Mira decides to name her character Grumpa, based on the fact that ogres can sometimes be cranky and, well, a bit grumpy._

_On the character sheet there is space for a fitting quote, something the player thinks captures the essence of the character or its views on life. Mira writes "You helped me, I'll help you" as Grumpa's quote, as it coincides with the ogre's goal (see below)._

_Regarding her background, Mira imagines that Grum pa was found wandering aimlessly along one of the many roads connecting keeps and villages on the southern border of Davokar. Grum pa was adopted by a traveling theater company, which had her do the heavy work like raising tents and digging latrines. Soon the leader of the company discovered that the ogre knew how to read people's minds. After that, the theater company added the act "Xavagunda -the Horrendous Witch" to their repertoire._

#### GOALS

It is hard to say something generic as to which goals a character or a group should choose. However, what is important is that the goals should make for exciting and interesting stories; the Game Master should be able to use the goals as a starting point for designing individual encounters or entire adventures.

It is also nice if the goals are tied to the game world of Symbaroum. The Campaign Book provides a wide collection oflocations, persons and events that the players can use for inspiration -for instance, names of noble families for a character to have a feud with.

_**Example:** After some thought Mira decides on a primary goal for her character: someone in Davokar taught her to use magic and play sad songs on the flute. Grumpa doesn't remember who this person was. Her goal is to find this person and repay her debt of gratitude. Mira lets the GM decide how and when this will come into play. She then decides on some goals together with the rest of the players in the group. The others like the idea of a theater company and they decide that all their characters should be tied to the company. They name it The White Dove's Theater Company. Collectively they make an addition to the backstory: the group is really a gang of thieves that's fronting as a theater company to be able to travel freely and to find suitable victims. Grumpa 's mind reading ritual is very useful when it comes to the latter. Together with the Game Master the group decides that The White Dove's Theater Company is headed for the plateau of Karvosti after a series of successful breakins (the group adds "Escape the fury of Baron Flagros" as one of their common goals). The barbarians are said to be gathering at the Thingstead, and many are drawn to Karvosti -an excellent opportunity for an exotic theater company with very nimble fingers!_
