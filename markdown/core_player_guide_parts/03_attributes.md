## Attributes

THE ATTRIBUTES are the backbone of the character, the core of its game mechanics. Simply put: whenever a character attempts to perform an action of dramatic significance, the player has to make a success test -the action is successful if the player rolls less than or equal to the value in one of the character's Attributes. This chapter describes the eight Attributes and how they are used within the game.

> #### Names of Attributes
> 
> Any of the Attributes can be renamed by players who wish them to suit his or her character better. Resolute might be better referred to as Faithful, Lucky or Fanatical. By the same token, Discreet can be Sneaky, Cunning can be Learned and Vigilant can be changed into Paranoid. The player decides what is best for the character.

### The Attributes

ATTRIBUTES ARE USED to determine just how prepared a character is to face different kinds of challenges in the game world. A character's value in an Attribute, such as Strongor Quick,indicates what kind oflife he or she has lived growing up. In other words, the attribute values make out a fairly stable foundation which will not change dramatically but that can be built upon and refined.

#### ACCURATE

A character's hand-eye coordination, precision and timing are all represented by Accurate. This Attribute is for instance used to hit an intended target with punches, strikes, throws or a missile from a ranged weapon. Accurate is in most cases opposed by an enemy's Quick.

#### CUNNING

The Cunning Attribute represents a character's wit and knowledge, its common sense as well as actual schooling and education. You usually test Cunning when trying to remember facts, when solving a logical problem or puzzle, or when doing research in a library. Cunningis usually tested against a specific level of Difficulty, decided by the Game Master.

#### DISCREET

A player character's value in Discreetmirrors its aptitude for and training in being silent, agile and, well, discreet. This Attribute can be used to avoid being detected, to hide or smuggle something, to shadow someone or to steal something out of a person's pocket. Discreet is often opposed by an enemy's Vigilant.

#### PERSUASIVE

Persuasive reflects how well a player character can influence others by use of words, voice, body language and looks. The Attribute is often used when trying to persuade another person to do (or refrain from doing) something, either verbally, in writing or by song. Persuasive is usually opposed by an enemy's Resolute.

#### QUICK

Quickrepresents a character's reflexes, balance, nimbleness and how fleet-footed he or she is. It determines the order of initiative in combat and is used actively when jumping, avoiding harm and performing similar acrobatic maneuvers. Quickis often opposed by an enemy's Accurate.

#### RESOLUTE

Resolute represents a character's resistance to influence, whether it is social pressure, mind-bending magic or Corruption. Resolute is also tied to the use of mystical powers. The Attribute is often opposed by either an enemy's Resolute or Persuasive. Note that having a very low value in this Attribute is inadvisable, because of the risk for Corruption.

#### STRONG

Strong mirrors a character's capacity to use its physical strength in order to, for instance, lift something heavy or break down a door. It also covers the capacity to withstand physical damage and to resist poisons and diseases. Strongis usually modified by a level of Difficulty, sometimes by an enemy's Strong.

#### VIGILANT

Vigilant represents a character's general awareness, the attunement ofits senses and its ability to detect the details of its surroundings. Vigilant is often opposed by an enemy's Discreet.

#### SECONDARY ATTRIBUTES

The following statistics are calculated based on the character's Attributes:
- Toughness = Strong (though never below 10)
- Pain Threshold = Strong/2 (rounded up)
- Defense = [Quick - Armor's Impeding value]
- Corruption Threshold = Resolute/2 (rounded up)

#### THE MEANING OF LOW ATTRIBUTES

Having a low value in an Attribute is actually a great starting point for deciding a character's appearance and personality. For instance, a character with a low value inAccurate can be one-eyed, or generally clumsy and prone to bumping into things. A low Cunning value can represent both impulsiveness and a lack of education; a low Quick could mean that the character is either indecisive or limping. Someone with a low Resolute could be afraid of conflicts or perhaps very superstitious. A loud and careless character probably has a low value in Discreet, while a low Vigilant value could result in a myopic and absent-minded daydreamer.

### Success Test

BETWEEN THEM, the Attributes can be used to undertake any kind of challenge in the game world. Sometimes they are used actively, when the character tries to achieve something; at other times they are used reactively to negate the actions of enemies or avoid being afflicted by environmental hazards. It is always the player who performs the test, whether it is made actively (the character affects the world) or passively (the world affects the character). The Game Master tells the player which Attribute must be tested and what modifications to apply (if any).

A success test is performed by rolling a 20-sided die, called a 020. In the most simple challenges success is only a matter of the die landing on a number which is equal to or lower than the character's attribute value. However, most often the attribute value is first modified according to the opposition or the difficulty of the challenge -for instance, if the character tries to hit someone with a spear, the relevant attribute value is modified by the target's Defense; when trying to open a lock, the attribute value is modified by how difficult the lock is to open.

In the latter case the Game Master determines the modification, typically from +5 (very easy) to -5 (very hard). When it comes to the spear attack, the actual modifier is determined with the formula [10 -the enemy's defense value] (see table to the right).

When a challenge is described in the text of this book it is always written with the character's Attribute first, like this: [Character's Attribute<-Modifier}. When the modification originates from passive resistance, as in the case of a lock, it is instead written [Character's Attribute -ModificationeX]. Finally, if the test is meant to be performed without any modifications the relevant Attribute is written in plain text with an initial capital letter: Quick.

For more details and examples, see the narrative tutorial starting on page 237.

__Table 5: Examples of Success Tests__
| SITUATION | SYSTEM |
|-----------|--------|
| The character sneaks up on a guard | Test the character's Discreet, modified by the guards Vigilant, written [Discreet<-Vigilant] 
| An enemy is sneaking up on the character | Test the character's Vigilant, modified by the enemy's Discreet, written [Vigilant<-Discreet] 
| The character enchants an enemy | Test the character's Resolute, modified by the enemy's Resolute, written [Resolute<-Resolute] 
The character gets close to a hidden trap | Test the character's Vigilant, modified by the trap's Difficulty, written [Vigilant -X], where X is the trap's Difficulty


> **Concerning the <-**
> 
> The arrow pointing leftwards and which is used in the formula for describing challenges means "modified by". Consequently, the formula [Quick<-Accurate] means "Quick modified by (the opponent's) Accurate: a modification which can be either positive (+) or negative (-).
