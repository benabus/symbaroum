## Equipment

NO CHARACTER 1s COMPLETE until he or she is equipped with weapons, supplies and alchemical elixirs. This chapter starts with a description of weapons, armors and their respective qualities, and after that follows a collection of general goods that the characters may need during their adventures. The cost of living is also covered, as well as prices and compensations for common services in Ambria.

### Weapons

EACH WEAPON DEALS a certain amount of basic damage to the target's Toughness, indicated by a specific die. Some weapons also have qualities that affect how they are used. Furthermore, some abilities can make it possible to use a weapon in other or more refined ways. In these cases, it is important to read the description of the ability thoroughly, to know exactly what the weapon can do in the hands of an experienced character.

#### HEAVY WEAPONS

**Damage**: 1D10

**Qualities**: None. The Bastard Sword is Precise, the Double Axe has the Deep Impact quality, the Heavy Flail is Jointed.

Heavy weapons are distinguished by the fact that they have to be wielded with two hands in order to be used effectively. They have a superior damage effect in melee combat. Pole axe, war hammer and the mighty great sword are all examples of heavy weapons common in the Davokar region.

**Bastard Sword**: The master smiths of the Pansars forge the finest weapons in Ambria, and the bastard swords of the Queen's Guard are an exquisite testament to that fact, at least when wielded by the right warrior. The weapon is preferably handled with both hands (as a heavy weapon) but can also be used single-handedly with a shield. When wielded with just one hand, the bastard sword loses the Precise quality and instead deals damage like a single-handed weapon.

**Double-axe**: The barbarian double-axe (not to be confused with the more common pole axe with its single-edged axe head) is aptly named after its twin axe heads and is presumed to be a legacy from the fallen Symbaroum. In those days the double-axe was a weapon as well as a symbol of status and standing. Even though the knowledge of metallurgy has dwindled since the fall of Symbaroum these powerful weapons can still be forged, often made for particularly prominent warriors. Ambrians consider the double-axe crude and savage, fit for barbarians and few else, but its shape is well known because of its similarity to the royal rune, Labrys.

**Heavy Flail**: The heavy flail is a Jointed weapon, where a metal ball -often spiked -attached to a two-handed shaft by a chain is swung against the enemy. It is not easy to parry a flail since the metal ball often strikes around the parrying weapon or shield to find its target.

The heavy flail comes in a number of shapes, like the traditional wooden two-handed shaft attached to a chain that ends in a spiked metal head. There are also variants with spiked pieces of metal that are linked together, as well as models where two or three chains and metal heads share the same shaft. Regardless of design, they all share the weight of the flail and the fact that they are difficult to block.

#### LONG WEAPONS

**Damage**: 1D8 

**Qualities**: Long. The Halberd has Deep Impact. the Pike is Precise, and the Quarterstaff is Blunt

Long weapons have the advantage of superior reach and give the user Free Attacks against enemies that are not armed with Long weapons themselves. A Long weapon can be used in one hand, but then loses the Long quality since the user is forced to hold it higher up on the grip to control the weapon. Spear and staff are examples of Long weapons.

**Halberd**: The halberd, known as the pole axe among barbarians, has elements of both the Long and the Heavy weapon since it is combining the point of a spear with the head of an axe. It cannot thrust as quickly as the spear, but its sweeping chop can have a devastating effect.

**Pike**: The slender shaft and fire-tempered steel point of the Ambrian pike slides towards the target with great precision.

**Quarterstaff**: The simpler wooden staff, often made from heavy wood that has been hardened with fire, has the reach of a Long weapon but lacks the effect of steel-tipped weapons.

> Where Ambrians prefer the sword the barbarian warrior favors the axe.

#### PROJECTILE WEAPONS

**Damage**: Crossbow 1D10, bow 1D8, sling 1D6

**Qualities**: The Arbalest has the Deep Impact quality and the Longbow is Precise.

Projectile weapons are meant to be used over greater distances and need some time to reload.

The crossbow is loaded with bolts, the bows fire arrows and slings throw sharpened rocks. A crossbow requires a Movement Action to be reloaded, while reloading a bow or a sling counts as a Free Action. Bow, crossbow and sling are all examples of projectile weapons.

**Arbalest**: The arbalest is a heavy Ambrian crossbow with a bow of feather steel, which gives its bolts a bit of extra punch.

**Longbow**: The longbow is a reliable and proven weapon in the Ambrian army, and since The Great War it is often carried by farmers who make up the backbone of the kingdom's archer companies.

#### SHIELDS

**Armor**: Providest+ 1 in Defense

**Qualities**: None. Bucklers are Flexible, Steel Shields are Balanced.

Shields make it difficult to hit the wielder with melee, as well as ranged, attacks. They are often combined with a single-handed weapon, or with a single-handed weapon and a number ofadditional throwing weapons.

**Buckler**: The buckler is a small shield commonly carried by elite archers and pikemen, since it is agile enough to be strapped to the arm while still allowing the use of both hands to wield a weapon. The Buckler is too light to be used with the Shield Fighter ability.

**Steel Shield**: The steel shield is as strong as the common wooden shields, but both thinner and more easily maneuvered.

#### SHORT WEAPONS

**Damage**: 1D6

**Qualities**: Short. The Parrying Dagger is Balanced and the Stiletto has the Deep Impact quality.

Short weapons can be drawn quickly and are easily hidden. Daggers and short swords are examples of Short weapons.

**Parrying Dagger**: The parrying dagger, with its wide and v-shaped cross-guard, has become very popular in Yndaros, and is often wielded together with a fencing sword.

**Stiletto**: The slender and agile stiletto is a dagger whose razor sharp point stabs deeply -the weapon of an assassin.

#### SINGLE-HANDED WEAPONS

**Damage**: 1D8 
**Qualities**: None. A Crow's Beak has the Deep Impact quality, a Fencing Sword is Precise, a Flail is Jointed.

The category of Single-handed weapons covers all kinds of weapons that can be wielded in one hand. Axe, saber, sword and war hammer are all examples of single-handed weapons.

**Crow's Beak**: A less elegant, but just as effective weapon is the Crow's Beak, also known as a Kandarian War Pick after the city in Alberetor where it was first forged. The Crow's Beak is a club whose metal head is fitted with a spike or a beak of steel, in order to punch through armor more easily. After the escape to Yndaros, the smiths of the Kandarian War Pick settled down in the district of Old Kadizar where they have continued to craft their dreaded weapons.

**Fencing Sword**: In Yndaros, the Ambrian fencing sword is considered to be of the highest fashion, an instrument with superior precision made from strong but flexible steel. It is often combined with the duelist's favorite, the parrying dagger, which gives the lightly armored fighter a stronger defense in combat.

**Flail**: The single-handed cousin of the heavy flail.

#### THROWING WEAPONS

**Damage**: 1D6 
**Qualities**: None. Spear Sling has the Deep Impact quality.

Throwing weapons are hurled single-handedly over short distances. They are usually used before melee combat is initiated, and are therefore often combined with a shield. Throwing axe, throwing knife and throwing spear are all examples of this weapon group.

**Spear Sling**: The barbarians of eastern Davokar, and especially the members of clan Karohar, prefer the use of spear slings -a throwing arm with a hook that is attached to the end of a short spear in order to throw it with tremendous force.

#### UNARMED ATTACKS

**Damage**: 1D4 

**Qualities**: Short. The Battle Claw has the Deep Impact quality.

Unarmed attacks are usually used as the last resort of cultural beings and are less effective than the natural weapons of beasts and abominations in almost all respects. Yet, with the Natural Warrior ability even an unarmed character can inflict considerable amounts of damage to its enemies. An elbow, a bite, a punch, a head-butt, a kick as well as the use of brass knuckles are examples of Unarmed Attacks. 

**Battle Claw**: The clan Karohar in southern Davokar has developed a clawed gauntlet that you wear on your hand and whose long claws simulate those of a mare cat. 

### Armor

EACH SUIT OF ARMOR provides a certain amount of protection, indicated by a specific die. Some armor also has qualities that affect how the armor works mechanically. Just like weapons, different cultures have developed a number of diverse kinds oftarmor, all with their respective advantages and disadvantages. 

#### LIGHT ARMOR 

**Armor**: 1D4 

**Qualities**: Impeding (-2). Many kinds of light armor have the Flexible quality, wolf skin armor has the Cumbersome quality. 

Light armor is easy to come by and does not limit the wearer's capabilities substantially in acrobatic situations or when performing stealthy maneuvers. Yet it has a negative effect when using mystical powers. Hardened, ring and studded leather are all examples oftlight armor. 

**Blessed Robe**: The priest robes of the theurgs are blessed and protected by benevolent forces so that the Church's finest can travel safely throughout the kingdom, and beyond. 

**Order Cloak**: Most novice mag es of Ordo Magic a are given a protective cloak in time for their first long journey. These cloaks are embroidered with warding runes, which increases the chance of the novice surviving to complete its appointed task.

**Witch Gown**: Witches bind protective spirits in carved pieces of bone and the skulls of fallen enemies, and attach them to their clothing for effective protection.

**Wolf Skin**: For poor barbarian scouts the cheap, cumbersome wolf skin armor is a common alternative; skin that has been tanned in the most simple way and sewn together into some kind of passable protection.

**Woven Silk**: Woven silk is the finest light armor available, since the close weave of its threads withstands stabs and cuts far better than its weight suggests. Woven silk has been used by both barbarians and Ambrians for a long time and some scholars speculate that the technique originally comes from the elves, possibly dating as far back as the days of the Iron Pact.


__Table 10: Armor__
| ARMOR             | PROTECTION   | QUALITY        | COST 
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|---------
| Light             | 1D4          | Impeding (-2)  | 2 thaler 
|   Blessed Robe    | 1D4          | Flexible       | 10 thaler 
|   Order Cloak     | 1D4          | Flexible       | 10 thaler 
|   Witch Gown      | 1D4          | Flexible       | 10 thaler 
|   Wolf Skin       | 1D4          | Cumbersome     | 1 thaler 
|   Woven Silk      | 1D4          | Flexible       | 10 thaler 
| Medium            | 1D6          | Impeding (-3)  | 5 thaler 
|   Crow Armor      | 1D6          | Cumbersome     | 2 thaler 
|   Lacquered Silk Cuirass | 1D6   | Flexible       | 25 thaler 
| Heavy             | 1D8          | Impeding (-4)  | 10 thaler 
|   Full Plate      | 1D8          | Flexible       | 50 thaler 


#### MEDIUM ARMOR

**Armor**: 1D6

**Qualities**: Impeding (-3). Some have the Flexible quality; Crow Armor has the Cumbersome quality.

Medium armor offers better protection than the light versions but at the cost of being more restrictive to the wearer's movements. However, this downside is considered an acceptable trade-offby most melee combatants. Scale-and chainmail are examples of medium armor.

**Crow Armor**: Medium armor is more expensive than light, which is the reason why many warriors have picked, riveted and bound together a so-called "Crow Armor" of their own. It is cheap, but far more difficult to move around in.

**Lacquered Silk Cuirass**: Barbarian warriors that have earned their place in the guard of a wealthy clan chieftain can sometimes be seen wearing a cuirass oflacquered silk, an armor that despite its apparent lightness protects like a breast plate. According to legend, the secret oflacquered silk was given to humankind by the elves, in a time when the Iron Pact was still strong and humans battled the parasitic darkness ofSymbaroum.

#### HEAVY ARMOR

**Armor**: 1D8

**Qualities**: Impeding (-4), Ambrian Full Plate has the Flexible quality.

Those melee combatants that can afford it usually chose increased protection at the cost of even greater restrictions to their movement. A self-respecting knight wears chainmail enforced by shoulder, knee and elbow plates, while those with the means tend to order themselves a personalized set of full plate armor.

**Full Plate**: Personalized full plate armor is available for those of sufficient means, and offers the best protection available with less restriction than many other kinds of heavy armor.

### Qualities

WEAPONS AND ARMOR have different qualities, described in the following. If the description of a quality ever comes into conflict with the rules of an ability, then the ability overrules the quality.

#### FLEXIBLE

The armor is unusually flexible and is less Impeding than its protective capability would suggest. For this reason a Flexible light armor has no penalty at all on Defense tests, sneaking and the use of mystic powers. A Flexible medium armor has a (-1) penalty and a Flexible heavy armor (-2).

A Flexible shield can be carried strapped to the arm, ready to use, while at the same time allowing the bearer to use both hands for wielding a Long or Heavy weapon. Even ranged weapons can be used without problem together with a Flexible shield.

#### BALANCED

The weapon is so well balanced that it is extra effective when parrying. The weapon provides +1 in Defense.

#### BLUNT

The weapon lacks either cutting or piercing abilities, and therefore uses one (1) Effect Die lower than other weapons of its kind. The quarterstaff, a Long weapon with the Blunt quality, deals 1D6 damage instead of 1D8, which is the usual damage for long weapons.

#### CUMBERSOME

It is difficult to move around in this armor and its Impeding effect is therefore one point higher than usual; a Cumbersome light armor has a penalty of (-3), a medium of (-4) and a heavy of (-5).

#### DEEP IMPACT

The weapon has qualities that makes it even more deadly. Maybe its blade can pierce armor more easily or the weapon itselfis so massive that it gets extra crushing power. Either way, the weapon deals +1 extra damage.

> _**What do you get for a thaler, a shilling, an orteg?**_
> 
> **A THALER**
> 
> A simple weapon or an even simpler suit of armor, or a common tool such as a scythe, or a cow, a pig, a dozen chickens or half a dozen sheep.
> 
> **A SHILLING**
> 
> A meal and the most simple of lodgings in a city or town.
> 
> **AN ORTEG**
> 
> A meager meal in a town, a meal and a place on a hayloft in the countryside.

#### IMPEDING

The armor hampers any agile movements and gives a penalty to tests against Defense,sneaking and the use of mystic powers. The penalty depends on whether the armor is light (-2), medium (-3) or heavy (-4).

#### JOINTED

The weapon is jointed, letting the head of the weapon strike past or around blocking weapons or shields, making it harder to parry. The length of the chain also makes the attacks difficult to evade. Even if a parry is successful, the attack hits if the die lands on an odd number; in which case the weapon deals 1D6 damage. This secondary damage is not affected by any abilities -it remains 1D6 regardless of the attacker's other abilities.

_**Example**: Grumpa defends herself against an attack from an enemy armed with a flail, a Jointed weapon. Her Defense is 6 and she rolls a 5, which should have been a successful parry -but Jointed weapons still hit on an odd number. Grumpa takes damage, though less than normal and none of the enemy's abilities can affect the damage, not even the passive ones. In the next turn, Grumpa is defending herself again and rolls 1. This defense is successful, since the result of her Defense test was an even number._

#### LONG

The weapon has the advantage of superior length and reach, giving the wielder one Free Attack each turn against an opponent that comes into range of melee combat, as long as said opponent is not also armed with a Long weapon.

#### PRECISE

The weapon is designed to be easy to wield and therefore gives +1to attack tests.

#### SHORT

The weapon can be drawn as a Free Action and can be used with the Feintability.

### Goods & Services

HERE FOLLOWS EQUIPMENT that the characters may need to survive on the road, as well as goods and services they might seek for a comfortable existence during their travels and in between adventures.

#### ALCHEMICAL ELIXIRS

The peoples of the Davokar region possess a vast knowledge ofhow to transform the herbs, fruits and bodily organs of nature into useful elixirs. Among the barbarians it is usually the witches who create the elixirs, while Ambrian decoctions are often made by specialized craftsmen and artisans.

**Antidote (Weak)**: A weak antidote lowers the effect of a poison by one degree; a strong poison becomes moderate, a moderate poison becomes weak and a weak poison is completely neutralized. The antidote does not affect any damage that a character has already suffered. Requires a passed Cunning test to take effect.

**Antidote (Moderate)**: A moderate antidote lowers the effect of a poison by two degrees; a strong poison becomes weak, while both moderate and weak poisons are completely neutralized. The antidote does not affect any damage that a character has already suffered. Requires a passed Cunning test to take effect.

**Antidote (Strong)**: A strong antidote lowers the effect of a poison by three degrees, which usually means that the poison is completely neutralized. The antidote does not affect any damage that a character has already suffered. Requires a passed Cunning test to take effect.

**Choking Spores**: Choking Spores are produced from Davokar's lichens and mushrooms. The elixir is used specifically with the Stranglerability.

**Concentrated Magic**: A dose of mystical essence, which gives a mystic a second chance to succeed with a Resolute test the next time he or she attempts to use a mystical power.

**Eye Drops**: These drops will immediately return the gift of sight to a temporarily blinded creature.

**Elemental Essence**: When applying a dose of elemental essence, either one weapon, four throwing weapons or all the arrows/bolts in a quiver deal 1D4 elemental damage for the duration of a scene. The alchemist must choose which element to prepare: fire, cold, acid or lightning.

**Elixir of Life**: Consuming an Elixir of Life gives the drinker regenerative powers that heal m6 points of Toughness during m6 turns, on the character's initiative. Sadly the character also suffers 1 temporary corruption for each turn the elixir is in effect.

**Ghost Candle**: The fumes from this candle make invisible things at a location or in a room visible.

**Herbal Cure**: An herbal cure consists of an alchemical poultice coupled with bandages. It smells vile but heals 1point of Toughness. The herbal cure has greater effect if used by a character with the Medicus ability.

**Poison (Weak)**: A weak poison deals 1D4 damage each turn for 1D4 turns. Poison (Moderate): A moderate poison deals m6 damage each turn for m6 turns. Poison (Strong): A strong poison deals rn8 damage each turn for m8 turns.

**Protective Oil**: The alchemical oil protects against elemental damage by providing rn4 additional Armor against one of the elements for the duration of a scene. The alchemist must choose which of the elements that the oil shields against: fire, cold, acid or lightning.

**Spore Bomb**: The spore bomb is used together with the Stranglerability. Waybread: One loaf of this rich waybread corresponds to a week's food supply for one person.

**Wraith Dust**: The wraith dust forces an incorporeal being {a creature with the monstrous trait Spirit Form) to take physical form for the duration ofta scene. The dust must be thrown with a {Accurate.Defense] test; if hit the spirit takes damage as living creatures do.

#### EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES

In the towns and cities of Ambria, a person with money in his or her pocket can purchase almost anything that adventurers and explorers might need. There is also the possibility to pay for numerous services, such as a bath and a shave, having a map drawn or hiring the protection ofbodyguards.

Goods and services grow scarcer both in the countryside and among the clans, so do not be surprised if the trader asks for a favor rather than coins as payment, should you actually find what you seek.

> ##### Equipment and problem-solving  
> 
> If a piece of equipment can be used to facilitate problem-solving or make a certain task easier to perform, then add a + 1 to the active Attribute. Decide within the gaming group from case to case.
