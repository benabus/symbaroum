## Abilities

The abilities are what really give a character in Symbaroum its distinct role and place in the game world. They represent a personâ€™s skill in utilizing his/her basic attributes as efficiently as possible and are graded in three levels from novice to master.

SOME ABILITIES are almost exclusively meant for combat, while others are more focused on problem-solving. Many can be used for both, in which case this is stated in the description of the ability. Also note that many abilities require the player to spend different kinds of Actions -read more about this in the chapter Player's Rules (page 158).

Abilities are rated in three levels: Novice, Adept and Master. An Adept may of course use the ability's Novice level effect, while a Master can make use of all three levels of the ability.

All abilities are described using the same template, with keywords defined as follows:
- **Active Action:** The ability is an attack or similar Combat Action. Some of the active abilities generate extra Actions. These extra Actions may not be used to perform an additional active Action, but they benefit from any passive abilities that the character may have.
- **Free Action:** This Action may be used an unlimited number of times per turn in addition to a character's usual two Actions, for as long as it is allowed by any conditions specified in the description of the ability.
- **Passive Action:** The ability does not require a Combat Action to be activated; in other words, the ability is always active. If a character has two or more passive abilities, then they are all considered active at the same time.
- **Reaction:** The ability is a Reaction to some other Action and therefore doesn't count against the two Actions a character can perform each turn. Reactive Actions work outside the usual order oflnitiative, since a Reaction is performed as a consequence of a triggering Action, regardless oflnitiative. Reactions can always make use of passive abilities, but never active ones.
- **Special Action:** The ability works in a special way, detailed in its description.

### ACROBATICS

The character has learned the art of acrobatic maneuvering, having spent time with a theater company, in one of the fencing schools ofYndaros or climbing the trees of Davokar. The nimbleness of the acrobat provides an advantage when trying to withdraw from close combat or when quickly wanting to reach the center of an enemy formation.

#### Novice 
**Reaction.** The character may roll against Quick to avoid Free Attacks from enemies in melee combat, either when trying to slip past an enemy or when attempting to withdraw from melee. Should the test fail, the player must choose to either remain in its original place or to move anyway and suffer a Free Attack from the opponent.
#### Adept 
**Free**. If the character is knocked down he or she may attempt to jump back up again as a Free Action by making a Quick test. If the test fails the character has to spend a Movement Action to get back on its feet, as usual.
#### Master
**Reaction**. The character can utilize its enemies as shields in battle. In combat with more than one opponent, the character may once per turn use an enemy as a shield and have that enemy suffer a successful hit instead of the character. That opponent cannot defend against the attack, but the master acrobat has to make a successful roll against Quick for the enemy to take the hit.

### ALCHEMY

The character is schooled in the mysteries of alchemy. With the right ingredients, the character can prepare various elixirs to help it survive in the dark depths of Davokar. A list of alchemical mixtures and potions are featured in Chapter 16: Equipment (page 153).

In problem-solving situations, Alchemy can be used to identify drugs and poisons and to gain clues as to where they come from. Other than that, the character may attempt to prepare an elixir once per adventure. This attempt can be performed before the start of an adventure or at any appropriate moment during the adventure -for example when traveling through a forest or when passing through a cave where potent ingredients may be found.

#### Novice 
**Special**. With a successful roll against Cunning the character can gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of a novice elixir.
#### Adept
**Special**. As an acknowledged alchemist the character can roll against Cunningto gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of an adept elixir or 1D4 doses of a novice elixir.
#### Master
**Special**. The character can, as a widely renowned alchemist, roll against Cunning to gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of a master elixir, 1D4 doses of an adept elixir or 1D8 doses of a novice elixir.

### BACKSTAB

The palace of Yndaros, the alleys of Thistle Hold and the gloom ofDavokar are extremely different surroundings, but they have at least one thing in common: when arguments fail, the blades speak up. The character has learned how to exploit weaknesses in an enemy's defense, and will not let an opportunity go by without making a Backstab.

#### Novice 
**Reaction**. One attack per turn made from Advantage deals + 1D4 damage in addition to any damage already inflicted thanks to the Advantage. The character may use Discreet instead of Accurate when making attacks while at an Advantage. Backstab may only be performed once per turn, regardless of other circumstances.
#### Adept
**Reaction**. The character's Backstab deals extra damage (as above) and also causes a bleeding wound to the enemy. The attack opens a wound that bleeds heavily, inflicting 1D4 damage each turn following the attack. The enemy continues to bleed until healed by an herbal cure, the Medicus ability or in some other way.
#### Master
**Reaction**. The character's Backstab deals 1D8 extra damage and causes a bleeding wound to the enemy, just like at adept level. There are no longer any limits to how many backstabs a Master can perform each turn. All attacks are backstabs as long as the conditions for Advantage are met (see page 162).

### BEAST LORE

The character is schooled in the lore of beasts and knows the secrets of most monsters. Many monsters possess special abilities and unique attacks as well as weaknesses which are good to know about when trying to bring them down. At higher levels the character must pick a specialization Abominations, Beasts, Cultural Beings or Undead -and receives further advantages against members of that specific category.

A character with Beast Lore can identify the tracks of many monsters and beings, and use that information to draw conclusions regarding the size and general behavior of the creature -is it hunting, on the run or just passing through?

#### Novice 
**Free**. The character has studied monsters and can make a Cunning test to recognize or recollect a monster's strengths and weaknesses. The Game Master describes the monster and its statistics to the player.
#### Adept 
**Free**. The character is an acknowledged scholar that has been studying a particular sub-category of monsters (pick Abominations, Beasts, Cultural Beings or Undead). The character now deals 1D4 additional damage to monsters from that category. This extra damage applies to the character's allies as well, if they have been instructed in how best to fight the creature.
#### Master
**Free**. The character now deals 1D6 extra damage to creatures from the sub-category that the player picked at the adept level. This extra damage applies to the character's allies as well, if they have been instructed in how best to fight the creature.

### BERSERKER
The feared barbarian warriors of Davokar have developed the practice of working themselves into a berserker frenzy before battle. By letting the repressed anger of the heart strengthen its limbs, the character can unleash a fuming rage that, if channeled correctly, might determine which side will emerge victorious from the battle.

#### Novice 
**Free**. As a Free Action, the character may enter into a murderous frenzy to solely focus on hurting the enemy, dealing 1D6 extra damage when fighting in melee combat. The downside of this frenzy is that the character cannot defend itself properly. The attribute on which Defense is based, is considered to be 5 when calculating Defense.
#### Adept 
**Reaction**. The rage is like armor to the character. He or she ignores 1D4 damage from each hit suffered while in a berserker rage.
#### Master
**Free**. The character has managed to harness its rage without losing any of its power. The character can utilize this capacity to both deal and ignore extra damage, while still being able to defend itself as normal.


### BODYGUARD

High-born Ambrians, rich merchant lords and other potentates surround themselves with bodyguards.

Even among the barbarians there are housecarls who serve to protect the life of their chieftain. The character is trained to place itself in the way of painful strikes and lethal blows aimed at the protected person.

#### Novice 
**Reaction.** With a successful Resolute, the character may take blows directed against an ally. The character may not defend itself against these attacks, they hit automatically.
#### Adept
**Reaction**. As Novice, but the character's capacity as a guardian allows it to defend itself against all attacks aimed at the person he or she is protecting.
#### Master
**Reaction**. As Adept, but the character is a veritable guardian saint. As a Reaction, the master Bodyguard also gets to make a Free Attack against anyone making a me lee attack aimed at the person under its protection.

### DOMINATE

With nothing but presence, gaze and voice, strong personalities can force weaker minds to bend in the midst of a raging battle. The character is trained in this art of subduing combat. Among the gladiators ofYndaros, this is considered to be a particularly impressive way to win a battle, and it is even regarded as extremely honorable among the barbarian clans to overcome your enemy in such a manner.

In social situations, this ability can also be used to scare someone into obedience and force secrets out of them.

#### Novice
**Passive**. The character can dominate and outmaneuver an enemy combatant by using its convincing personality. The character may use Persuasive instead of Accurate in melee combat.
#### Adept 
**Free**. The character can, as a Free Action and with a successful [Persuasive<-Resolute] test, force an enemy to hesitate in melee combat. A hesitating enemy will not attack the character this turn. If possible, it attacks one of the character's allies instead.
#### Master
**Active**. The character can subdue an enemy with a passed [Persuasive<-Resolute] test. A subdued enemy can be forced to stand down and negotiate, to flee from an ongoing battle (if possible), or surrender if it is impossible to flee. When already in combat, the enemy must first be wounded by the character or by one of the character's allies before it can be subdued.

> ### Monster categories
> #### ABOMINATIONS
> The horrible twisted life forms unique to Davokar.
> #### BEASTS
> All animals and creatures that belong to nature, such as wolves, reptiles and spider-like pests.
> #### CULTURAL BEINGS
> Humans, elves, changelings, ogres, goblins and trolls, for example.
> #### UNDEAD
> All manner of restless dead, such as ghosts and dragouls of any kind.

### EQUESTRIAN

Heavy cavalry dominates the plains of Ambria, a truth proven time and again by Queen Korinthia when she sent her armored horsemen against stubborn barbarians during the first decade of her invasion. It takes training to be able to use a mount in combat, both for the rider and the mount, but if they are able to work together as one, they become a deadly combination. This ability is also efficiently used by the barbarians of the western plains, who launch raids against the settlements of westernAmbria using their horse-drawn chariots.

A character with the Equestrian ability also has a good hand with other kinds of farm animals and the like, and can therefore use the ability to calm agitated beasts, for instance keeping watch dogs from barking.

#### Novice
**Rection**. The character is an experienced rider and used to fighting while mounted. The character knows how to use the weight of the mount in a cavalry charge and deals 1D6 additional damage with one melee attack if the mount moves prior to the attack.
#### Adept  
**Active**. The bond between a mount and its rider makes it possible for them to make sweeping attacks, meaning that they use parts of their Move Action before an attack, and the rest afterwards. This way, they are able to perform a melee attack without being locked into melee combat. The enemy can only retaliate by using Reactions, or by spending their Movement Action trying to catch up with the rider.
#### Master
**Reaction**. The master rider can use a cavalry charge even more effectively and therefore deals + 1D10 damage with one melee attack if the mount moves prior to the attack.

### EXCEPTIONAL ATTRIBUTE

All the character's senses, as well as its physical and mental capacity, can be improved. By practicing a little bit each day, the muscles can grow stronger, the eyes sharper and intellect vaster. This ability enhances the character's basic survival capability.

This ability may be chosen multiple times, each time related to a different Attribute.

#### Novice 
**Special**. The character has cultured one of its Attributes through hard work, which increases the Attribute value by + 1.
#### Adept 
**Special**. As novice, but the ability increases the Attribute value by +2 in total. 
#### Master 
**Special**. As novice, but the ability increases the Attribute value by +3 in total.

### FEINT

Persons and creatures that lack the will or strength to wield heavy melee weapons have instead developed techniques for feinting. This ability demands a weapon with either the Short or the Precise quality. Thanks to the skill of the character, these weapons can be handled in a both discreet and confusing manner.

#### Novice 
**Passive**. The character can choose to attack with Discreet instead of Accurate when the attack is made with a melee weapon which is either Short or Precise. Also, every such attack gains the same Advantage as if the opponent was surprised.
#### Adept
**Reaction**. The character presents a false weakness in its defense and tricks the opponent into attacking that weakness. The character can choose to defend itself with Discreet instead of Quick.
#### Master
**Active**. With a successful roll against [Discreet<-Vigilant] the character can surprise an enemy in the middle of an ongoing fight. A successful test gives the character a Free Attack against that enemy in addition to its ordinary attack. The character may still perform an ordinary attack even if the attempted Feint fails.

### IRON FIST

The character is trained to use its strength for maximum effect on a target in melee combat. Knights, members of the barbarian Wrathguard and other heavily armed warriors rely on their strength in combat and leave precision and finesse for others to worry about.

#### Novice 
**Passive**. The character can fully utilize its strength and therefore uses Strong instead ofAccurate when making melee attacks.
#### Adept
**Passive**. The character's melee attacks now deal 1D4 additional damage.
#### Master
**Active**. The character knows how to truly put its back into an attack. The character can perform a devastating melee attack once per turn that deals + 1D8, instead of +1D4, additional damage.

### LEADER

There are many who fight their way to a position ofleadership, but there are few who get pointed out as true leaders by the people they are meant to lead. If equipped with this ability the character is an inspiring, charismatic and eloquent person whom others listen to and follow, sometimes to their death.

Outside of combat, the Leader ability can be useful to seize command over a group of strangers, organize a militia and the like.

#### Novice 
**Passive**. Due to its strong personality, the character can use Persuasive in place of Resolute, for instance when weaving mystical powers**, though not as a basis for the corruption threshold.
#### Adept 
**Active**. The character can nominate a creature or an object to be the focused target of his or her allies for the duration of a scene. All allies who attack that target inflict 1D4 additional damage with each hit. Changing the target requires a new active Action from the Leader.
#### Master
**Active**. The Leader gives a rousing speech to its allies. This allows them to use his or her Persuasive instead of their own Resolute for the duration of a scene.

### LOREMASTER

The character is educated and well-versed in the ways of the world: its cultures, its history, languages and artifacts. For centuries heroes, monsters and kingdoms have come and gone and left behind powerful items and secret texts. This ability represents knowledge about such objects. Through extensive studies a character with this ability knows not only the story of an object but also its properties and applications.

The Loremaster ability also makes the character skilled at researching records and administrative documents, something which might be very useful when faced with those kinds of problems and puzzles.

#### Novice 
**Free**. With a successful Cunning test, a Loremaster can figure out the properties of a specific artifact without being bound to it. In the same way, the novice can use Cunning to translate a text or understand what is being said in another human language. A character does not need to make a test when uttering simple words and phrases, but a successful roll against Cunning is required when trying to have a proper conversation.
#### Adept 
**Free**. The character is a cultivated scholar of artifacts -in cases when an artifact power is activated by a simple attribute test, the adept can roll against Cunning instead of whichever attribute is specified in the description of the power. Also, with a successful Cunning test, the adept can read and understand the ungainly tongues of both elves and trolls. To say simple phrases in Elvish or Troll Tongue requires no test, but to initiate a conversation requires a successful roll against Cunning.
#### Master
**Free**. As an acknowledged interpreter of scrolls, the character may with a successful roll against Cunning activate mystical powers directly from scrolls and parchments. The Loremaster may also use Cunning instead of Resolute to resist mystical effects. Furthermore, the master is familiar with the secrets of Symbaroum. A successful Cunning test is required to be able to read a text written in its ancient and extinct language. It requires no test to utter simple phrases, but to initiate a conversation requires a successful roll against Cunning.

> ##### THUS SPOKE AROALETA
> " ... and he who was called 'first among equals' was nevertheless the fastest, the toughest and the most skilled with the spear; he was Maiesticar, the pillager who thrust Spiderbane at the heart ofthe Spider King, and all the way through."

> #### Ability and Powers
> A clarification may be warranted regarding the ability Mystical Power and the actual powers presented with start on page 130. Each of the latter represent one purchase of the ability in question: if your character learns both Lay on Hands and Holy Aura, this means it learns two different versions of the ability Mystical Power. What is in common for all powers is included in the ability; what is specific is detailed in the description of the powers.

### MAN-AT-ARMS

A real warrior wears armor and is trained in how to move and fight while doing so. This is true among Ambrians and barbarians alike, even if the most heavily armored warriors usually are of Ambrian stock. No matter what the armor is made from, be it leather, steel or any other material, the Man-at-arms ability gives the character increased protection against hostile strikes and blows.

#### Novice 
**Passive**. The character knows how to use its armor for maximum effect, which increases the armor's Armor tier by one step: light armor protects 1D6, medium armor protects 1D8 and heavy armor protects 1D10.
#### Adept
**Passive**. The character is used to wearing armor and can adapt his or hers actions to its limitations. The armor no longer has a negative effect on Quick or abilities based on Quick (including Defense). The Impeding quality of the armor still has a negative effect when using mystical powers.
#### Master
**Reaction**. The character may roll against Quick to counteract effects from Abilities or equipment that make enemy attacks ignore or reduce its Armor value; if the test is successful the Armor protects as usual. Mystical powers that ignore Armor may not be blocked this way; they are not affected by the Man-at-arms ability.

### MARKSMAN

Marksmen have their natural position in every army, scouting party and band of brigands. The character can inflict serious damage on its enemies with a bow or crossbow, hoping to either bring them down or at least make sure that they do not reach those of the character's allies that are equipped for melee combat.

#### Novice
**Passive**. Thanks to the character's skill, damage dealt with bows and crossbows is increased to 1D10 and 1D12 respectively, from the usual 1D8 and 1D10.
#### Adept
**Active**. The character's precision provides his or her projectiles a crippling effect. The attack deals damage as usual and if the target is wounded the character may make an [Accurate<-Strong] test every time the target attempts to move. A successful test means that the target cannot move and its Movement Action is forfeit. As soon as the target manages to move (the character fails the test), the crippling effect is gone.
#### Master
**Active**. The master's projectiles become armor piercing. The shot hits a weak spot and completely ignores the target's Armor.

### MEDICUS
The character is schooled in the art of healing and therefore a greatly coveted asset in its society, whether he or she keeps diseases from spreading, takes care of wounded warriors or tends to the ruling elite. The art of healing has been developed in parallel with alchemy, and many healers are also trained in alchemy for this reason, especially those who operate far from civilization where there are no herbal cures to buy from well-stocked merchants.

A character with the Medicus ability can diagnose and cure diseases and identify a poison by its symptoms. Medicus also gives the character a coroner's point of view, which might come in handy when examining a crime scene or a dead body.

#### Novice 
**Active**. As a clever surgeon, the character can make a test against Cunning to heal 1D4 of a patient's Toughness, or 1D6 when using an herbal cure. This ability can only be used once per patient and day.
#### Adept
**Active**. The character is an acknowledged Medicus. A successful Cunning test heals 1D6 of a patient's Toughness, or 1D8 when using an herbal cure. This ability can only be used once per patient and day.
#### Master
**Active**. The master Medicus has a vast medical knowledge. A successful Cunning test now heals 1D8 Toughness, or 1D10 when using an herbal cure. Even a failed test heals some of the patient's Toughness; 1D4 when only using Medicus or 1D6 when also applying an herbal cure. This ability can only be used once per patient and day.

### MYSTICAL POWER

The character has access to one or more mystical powers. These powers have either been obtained as a gift, a curse, through assiduous studies or as a consequence of a deep and dedicated faith. The character's power may belong to a mystical tradition (Wizardry, Sorcery, Theurgy or Witchcraft), which all have their benefits and disadvantages. The character may also be a Mystic without a tradition, with a homebrewed theory as to where these powers come from and what they are meant for. For more information see Chapter 18: Mystical Traditions (page 126).

Each Mystical Power is its own ability and is purchased separately. For a more detailed description of the different mystical powers, see Chapter 19: Mystical Powers (page 130).

The character suffers one point (1) of permanent Corruption each time he or she learns a new mystical power. The Corruption can be reduced if the power is part of a mystical tradition that the character belongs to. The character also suffers 1D4 temporary Corruption each time this power is used. Again, the Corruption suffered can be reduced if the power is considered a part of a tradition that the character belongs to (see Shadow & Corruption, page 174).

#### Novice 
**Special**. The character has mastered the power's novice level. 
#### Adept 
**Special**. The character has mastered the power's adept level. 
#### Master 
**Special**. The character has mastered the power's master level.

### NATURAL WARRIOR

A sword or a bow is not always needed to fight. Through long and hard training, the character has become a dangerous opponent even when unarmed. The barbarians of the forests have proud traditions of wrestling and boxing. Another example is the fighting style developed in the gutters of eastern Yndaros, a style that nowadays can be seen at the Dome since a pair of the city's renowned gladiators have embraced its techniques.

#### Novice 
**Passive**. The character has learned to use its natural-born warrior capabilities with great efficiency. The character"s unarmed attacks now deal 1D6 damage. If the creature has the Natural Weapons trait as well, then the damage is further increased according to the level of that monstrous trait.
#### Adept
**Active**. With the speed of an adept, the character may now perform a double attack against a single target. The two attacks are rolled separately.
#### Master
**Passive**. By attacking an opponent's weak points with flawless precision -such as throat and knees- the master's unarmed strikes are truly devastating. Each attack that hits deals 1D6 extra damage.

### POISONER

Davokar hides many alchemically potent and poisonous plants, and the character is familiar with the effective use of poisoned weapons in combat. Poisons can be purchased from less scrupulous peddlers, but to actually brew a poison requires some understanding of alchemy (the Alchemy ability).
The Poisoner ability can be used to identify different poisons or the effect of a poison on a wounded or dead person.

#### Novice 
**Free**. As a free action, the character can apply one dose of poison or any other alchemical elixir to a weapon. That one dose of poison is enough for one hit with the weapon before more of the poison must be applied. A [Cunning<-Strong] test is needed for the poison to take effect; if successful the victim starts to take damage. The damage suffered per turn and the duration of the poison depends on its strength (see page 153).
#### Adept 
**Free**. As novice, but the character understands how to make a dose of poison last an entire battle. After applying a dose, all attacks counts as poisonous for the duration of the combat scene.
#### Master
**Free**. The character has mastered the art of poisoning and knows how to get the most out of a poison. If the character succeeds with a Cunningtest. any poison applied to a weapon counts as one level higher than usual. Weak poison counts as Moderate, Moderate counts as Strong. Strong poison does not deal any additional damage but gives the character a second chance to succeed with the [Cunning<-Strong]test instead.

### POLEARM MASTERY

The character is initiated in the secrets oflongshafted weapons. The spear is a simple weapon and anyone can quickly learn how to make good use of its length. For this reason, the militia armies of the plains and forests are often armed with spears.

The character's advanced skill with long weapons really shows that a simple shaft of hardened wood can be a fearsome weapon in the hands of a trained warrior.

#### Novice
 **Passive**. The damage dealt by Long weapons is increased one step, to 1D10 for spears and halberds and to 1D8 for staves.
Adept Reaction. The character has truly mastered the long thrust. The character receives a Free Attack against all enemies w#### ho 
**come** into range of melee combat -whether it is the enemy who engages the character or vice versa is irrelevant. The only exception is when the enemy also wields a long weapon: in such a situation the character receives no Free Attack.
#### Master
**Reaction**. As a Master of long weapons, the character has the skill to keep his or her enemies at bay. The character can use the Free Attack with a polearm to keep an enemy from coming close enough to attack. For as long as the character succeeds in hitting the enemy, the enemy remains unable to attack the character with melee weapons whether or not the damage penetrates the enemy's armor.

> ##### The defensive strength of Polearm Mastery
> If you want a strongly defensive character. then Polearm Mastery is not a bad option. The adept level provides Free Attacks against any enemy who attempts to come close, which is very good in a fight against multiple opponents. The master level of Polearm Mastery is one of the most powerful abilities in terms of holding enemies in check. But also note that an enemy armed with a polearm more or less cancels the effect of Polearm Mastery.

### QUICK DRAW

Dealing the first blow can decide the outcome of a battle, and with this ability the character has an advantage when an unexpected ambush happens. The character also becomes a much more dynamic warrior, able to quickly switch weapons to meet the demands of any situation -a skill particularly appreciated among barbarian skirmishers and Ambrian archers.

#### Novice 
**Free**. With a successful test against Quick, the character may unsheathe and draw a weapon as a Free Action, thereby being able to use the weapon as if it was already drawn. The character can also reload a crossbow as a Free Action with a successful Quick Test.
#### Adept
**Free**. With a successful Quick test. the character may switch weapons as a Free Action, meaning that the character can sheathe one weapon and draw another in one fluid motion.
#### Master
**Free**. The character handles elixirs swiftly and may with a successful Quick test pour one dose down its own or someone else's throat as a Free Action.

### RECOVERY

Among both Black Cloaks and Mystics, meditative techniques that provide strange bodily capabilities have been developed. The character can use its inner power reserves with an almost magical self-discipline to rejuvenate the energy ofits body, even when in the midst of combat.

#### Novice
**Active**. With a successful die roll against Resolute, the character regains 1D4 Toughness. Multiple attempts can be made, but only one successful attempt is allowed per day.
#### Adept 
**Active**. Just as novice level, but the character recovers 1D6 Toughness. 
#### Master 
**Active**. Just as adept level, but the character recovers 1D8 Toughness.

### RITUALIST

The character has learned how mystical powers can be channeled through rituals -powerful but time-consuming magical practices. This knowledge may come from studying under a teacher or from self-studies with a ritual codex.

The character suffers one (1) permanent Corruption from each ritual it learns, except if the ritual belongs to a mystical tradition practiced by the character. In the latter case the character is spared the blight of Corruption.

When it comes to performing rituals, the character suffers rn4 temporary Corruption if the ritual does not belong to a tradition he or she has mastered. Performing rituals covered by the character's tradition only gives one (1) point of temporary Corruption.

The Ritualist ability makes it possible for the character to recognize what ritual has been performed by examining symbols and components remaining on the scene, and also to deduce the effects of the ritual, even ifhe or she has not mastered it.

#### Novice 
**Special**. The character has learned to perform one (1) ritual. The ritual may belong to any mystical tradition, but the character must have access to the ritual in order to learn and memorize it. The knowledge may be gained from a tutor involved in the same organization as the character, from a codex found in the ruins of Symbaroum or from another ritualist who imparts the knowledge as a reward for services rendered.
#### Adept 
**Special**. The character has learned to perform up to two additional rituals (three in total), again from any mystical tradition, but bound to the same conditions as those presented at the novice level.
#### Master
**Special**. The character has learned to perform up to three additional rituals (six rituals in total). Just as before, the Master Ritualist is not limited to the rituals of a single mystical tradition, but must have access to the ritual to be able to learn and memorize it.

### SHIELD FIGHTER

The character is trained in how to make good use of a shield, and how to actively fight using the shield as a weapon. Behind the protection of the shield, the character can generate a great momentum to fuel its attacks, as well as strike with the shield itself. This is an effective combination which probably explains why it is so common among both barbarian and Ambrian warriors.

The buckler, the light shield usually utilized by archers, is too light to be used with the Shield Fighterability. The warrior has to carry a sturdy shield made of either wood or steel to generate the required amount of force.

#### Novice 
**Passive**. The damage dealt by weapons held in the character's sword arm is increased by one step; to 1D10 if the character fights with a single-handed weapon or to 1D8 if using a Short weapon. The novice Shield Fighter also wields its shield as an instrument of protection with greater efficiency and therefore receives a +2 Defense bonus instead of the usual + 1 when using a shield.
#### Adept 
**Reaction**. The character has learned how to combine weapon and shield so well that every successful attack may be followed up by a shield bash against the same target (separate attack roll). If it hits. the damage of the shield bash is 1D4, and should the shield fighter make a successful test against [Strong<-Strong] the target is also knocked to the ground.
#### Master
**Reaction**. The damage of the shield bash is increased from 1D4 to 1D8 and the target is knocked to the ground if the character succeeds with a [Strong<-Strong] test.

### SIXTH SENSE

When moving through dark forests and underground tunnels, one's eyes are no longer very useful. Lighting a lantern or torch may summon dangers, so the explorer had better learn to rely on his or her other senses. With dedicated training it is possible to awaken these other senses and sharpen them to the brink of eeriness. The Sixth Sense ability provides the character with unique capabilities when fighting at a distance or in situations where eyesight can no longer be trusted.

A character with Sixth Sense may under calm circumstances navigate unhindered in dim light, as well as maintain a sense of direction in complete darkness, though at a pace of only a quarter of its normal, daytime speed.

#### Novice 
**Passive**. The character has a strong intuition, which lets him or her use Vigilant instead of Accurate when attacking with ranged weapons.
#### Adept
**Passive**. The character's intuition has expanded and the character may now use Vigilant instead of Quick for Initiative and when calculating his or her Defense.
#### Master
**Passive**. The character can move and fight unhindered when blinded or in complete darkness.

### SORCERY

The character is one of those who are arrogant or desperate enough to cling to the darkness. While other mystical traditions do everything they can to avoid the soul-eroding powers of Corruption, the sorcerer chooses to do the opposite.

The powers and rituals of Sorcery rely on the force of corruption and the possibilities offered by the taint. The sorcerer must always balance between grasping the black power that is just within its reach and remaining independent of the darkness. Most sorcerers realize that their chosen path only holds one possible end, and the most depraved among them have already come to terms with this, seeing their final and inevitable enslavement as some sort of salvation.

#### Novice 
**Special**. The sorcerer has taken its first faltering steps down the slippery slope of darkness and has found a way to not lose its foothold entirely. The sorcerer can reduce the Corruption he or she suffers from. By making a successful roll against Resolute each time the sorcerer suffers Corruption, he or she only receives one (1) point of Corruption.
#### Adept
**Reaction**. The sorcerer can draw from its own Corruption to successfully use mystical powers. A sorcerer who fails in an attempt to use a power may try again, this time rolling against his or her Total Corruption value. Should this test be successful, then the power is activated as normal, but the sorcerer also suffers an additional 1D4 temporary Corruption.
#### Master
**Special**. The sorcerer can use the Corruption of others in order to enforce its will. Each time the sorcerer attempts to affect the Resolute attribute of another creature, he or she may choose to roll against the creature's Shadow instead (the creatures Resolute -Total Corruption). Thoroughly corrupted creatures are strangely immune to this; it is as if they feed off the darkness of the world to carry on with their dark calling.

### STEADFAST

Mental disciplines and stratagems for resisting improper influences have been developed among the ranks of the Templars and Black Cloaks. Also among Mystics there are individuals who study the art ofresistance.

The character has a mind as hard as steel, inspiring it to fight on even against insurmountable odds. Mystics rarely succeed when trying to hurt or seize control of the character's senses, and sometimes a truly steadfast character manages to defend itself mentally and even turn the magic back on the hostile mystic.

#### Novice 
**Reaction**. The character can make a second attempt to succeed with a Strong or Resolute test when trying to break an ongoing physical effect from, for instance, traps or alchemical elixirs. This includes energies from mystical powers, as long as these are manifested physically in the forms of fire, acid or similar.
#### Adept
**Reaction**. The character is unshakable, and can make a second attempt to shrug off ongoing powers that affects either its will or its senses.
#### Master
**Reaction**. The psyche of the character strikes back against anyone who tries to affect it. Whenever the character is the victim of a mental attack (in other words, those attacks that are modified by Resolute) that fails, the attacker suffers 1D6 damage that ignores Armor.

### STEEL THROW

There are traditions and groups whose representatives have practiced the art of the thrown weapon for generations. Throwing knives are for instance common among thieves and thugs in the cities, and in the woods many clan warriors are equipped with throwing axes or spears. In fact, most barbarian fighters (especially those within the clan of Zarek) regularly use throwing weapons as part of their combat tactics, unleashing a shower of steel just before they charge into the fray.

#### Novice 
**Passive**. The character has begun to understand the riddle of steel-throwing. The damage dealt by throwing weapons is increased to 1D8.
#### Adept
**Active**. The character can perform a double throw with one Action. The attacks are rolled separately and are either aimed at the same target, or at two different ones. The character can also use melee weapons as throwing weapons, but can only throw one such weapon per Action. The damage for this kind of attack is the base damage of the melee weapon, including any passive abilities that the thrower might have.
#### Master
**Active**. The character can unleash a devastating triple throw and send three throwing weapons towards his or her enemies, all of them against a single target or distributed among multiple ones.

### STRANGLER 

The character has been initiated into the dirty, but sometimes necessary, art of strangulation. This fighting technique has a bad reputation among

Ambrians and barbarians alike, but that does not mean that it is not widely desired by those who want enemies or their guards discreetly taken care of. With this ability the character can do a lot of damage to an unprepared or slow enemy with either a garrote or, if more advanced, with the alchemical Choking Spores.

#### Novice 
**Active**. The novice Strangler may attack when at an Advantage. A successful attack deals 1D6 damage each turn and ignores Armor. The target cannot act until the Strangler's hold is aborted; the character maintains the stranglehold with a successful [Cunning<-Cunning].
#### Adept 
**Active**. The character knows how to use the deadly Choking Spores, gathered deep within Davokar by alchemists. With a successful [Cunning<-Quick], the spores are thrown at an enemy and deal 1D4 damage per turn for 1D4 turns, ignoring Armor. There is no known countermeasure against the effect of the Choking Spores, other than healing the victim when the damage appears. Affected victims may act as usual, in contrast to the novice level of this ability. 
#### Master 
**Active**. The character can use the delicate and lethal Spore Bombs created from Choking Spores by master alchemists. If thrown over a distance, it requires a successful Cunning test for the bomb to land on the intended spot. The Spore Bomb fills a corridor, a smaller area or an ordinary room with a suffocating cloud. Anyone who stands within that area, enemies as well as allies, are affected by the Choking Spores, which ignore Armor and deal 1D4 damage per turn for a duration of 1D4 turns.

### TACTICIAN

According to Ambrians, scholarly knowledge is counted as one of the highest virtues. Hence, it is hardly surprising that Ambrian scholars have studied skirmishes meticulously to see if the tactics of battles can work on a lesser scale, among smaller groups and even in duels. The result is a style of combat governed by strict principles and calculations, which over time can out-maneuver even the most aggressive attacker. The character is trained in this scholarly warrior tradition.

A schooled tactician may also use this ability to analyze a tactical approach and find both its strengths and weaknesses. This can be done for offensive purposes when facing a hostile group or defensively, to establish a strong defense.

#### Novice 
**Passive**. The character has studied the tactics of warfare and grasped its fundamental principles. The character may use Cunning instead of Quick when calculating its Initiative.
#### Adept
**Passive**. The character has mastered the art of a good defensive posture, which allows him or her to use Cunning instead of Quick when calculating Defense.
#### Master
**Passive**. The character is a genius when it comes to offensive warfare, which allows the character to use Cunning instead of Accurate when attacking with anything but heavy weapons.

### THEURGY

Theurgy is the mystical tradition championed by the chosen priest mages of the Church of Prios. Theurgy is the doctrine of the inner flame, where the ember of the soul is seen as a reflection of the divine and life-giving light of the sun.

#### Novice 
**Special**. The theurg no longer suffers permanent Corruption when learning powers at novice level belonging to the tradition of Theurgy, nor when learning its rituals. Despite this, the character still has no protection against the t emporary Corruption that comes from using the powers and rituals of Theurgy.
#### Adept 
**Special**. The theurg no longer suffers permanent Corruption when le#### arning 
**powers** at adept level belonging to the tradition of Theurgy. The adept theurg has also learned to rest the powers and rituals of Theurgy on a foundation of faith so that the theurg now only suffers one (1) temporary Corruption when casting them.
#### Master
**Special**. The theurg has reached a higher understanding of the essence of its powers, and therefore gains+ 1D4 in effect when using healing and holy powers, including when these damage abominations and the undead. Adding to this, the theurg suffers no permanent Corruption when learning powers at master level belonging to the tradition of Theurgy.

### TWIN ATTACK

Barbarians, Ambrians and goblins all have fighting techniques involving the use of more than one weapon. The character has learned how to fight with two weapons, an advanced but effective technique that gives the warrior an offensive advantage. Twin Attack is especially effective against lightly armored targets.

#### Novice
**Active**. The character can safely wield two weapons, one in each hand. The novice can fight with a single-handed weapon in its primary hand and a Short weapon in the other. The character can make two attacks against the same target, dealing 1D8 and 1D6 damage respectively. The enemy must defend itself separately against the attacks. The novice also receives a +l bonus to its Defense as a Passive ability, but only when wielding a weapon in each hand.
#### Adept
**Active**. The adept can use two single-handed weapons, each attack dealing lD8adamage.
#### Master
**Active**. With the skill of a Master, the damage dealt by the main-hand weapon is 1D10 while the weapon in the other hand deals 1D8.

### TWO-HANDED FORCE

The knights of Ambria as well as the Wrath guards of Karvosti dress themselves in steel from head to toe and have realized that with that much armor, they are free to focus on dealing massive amounts of damage.

Heavy two-handed weapons rest comfortably in the character's callused hands and can have an astoundingly destructive effect on all sorts of targets. Heavy weapons are extra effective against heavily armored enemies.

#### Novice 
**Passive.** The damage dealt by heavy weapons is increased to 1D12.
#### Adept
**Reaction**. The character has mastered the use of its weapon, so when an attack misses a target the character may instead use the returning swing in an attempt to hit the target again. The character makes a new attack roll, which deals 1D8 damage if it hits.
#### Master
**Active**. A heavy weapon in the hands of a master is truly a tool of armor-crushing destruction. When the attacks of a master hit the target, they completely ignore the target's Armor.

### WITCHCRAFT
From the deep soils and wild spirits of Davokar comes the tradition of witchcraft. For generations, its teachings have been passed on to witches who, alongside the chieftains, have led the people of the forests through mishaps and triumphs alike. Surely, it is the primal powers of witchcraft that enables the barbarian clans to live within Davokar.

#### Novice 
**Special**. The witch has learned the teachings of witchcraft and how to withstand its darker elements. The witch no longer suffers any permanent Corruption from learning powers at novice level belonging to the Witchcrafttradition, nor when learning any of its rituals. Despite this, the character still suffers the temporary Corruption that follows when using the powers and rituals of Witchcraft.
#### Adept
**Special**. The witch suffers no Corruption from learning the powers of Witchcraft at adept level. The adept witch has also learned to bind the powers and rituals of the craft in earth, blood and spirit so that they only give one (1) temporary Corruption when used.
#### Master
**Special**. The witch suffers no Corruption from learning the powers of Witchcraft at the master level.

### WITCHSIGHT

By way of the shadows surrounding creatures, locations and objects the world's deeper conflicts are observable for a character with the Witchsight ability. Opening up one's mind in order to examine the world of shadows can provide invaluable insights, but it also entails great risk: the more open the mind is and the deeper the insights are, the greater the risk ofbecoming tainted by the darkness of the world. It is for this reason that masters of this ability seldom use it to their full capacity.

As previously stated, the color of the Shadows can give the character clues regarding the spiritual alliance of the inspected creature (see Shadow & Corruption, page 174). The Game Master manages the nuances and powers of the Shadows and describes what the character sees with its Witchsight.

#### Novice 
**Free**. As a Free Action, the character can make a roll against [Vigilant<-Discreet] in an attempt to see the dominant Shadow of a creature, location or object. Each such attempt forces the character to suffer 1 temporary Corruption.
#### Adept
**Free**. The character has gained the greater insight of an adept regarding auras and mystical phenomenon. Witchsight now reveals all Shadows of an inspected target but not their respective strengths. The character suffers 1D4 temporary Corruption each time he or she attempts to see the Shadows of a creature, location or object.
#### Master
**Free**. The character has achieved the master's superior insights and can now see all Shadows and their respective strengths clearly. The character suffers 1D6 temporary Corruption each time an attempt is made to see the Shadows of a creature, location or object.

### WIZARDRY

Wizardry is taught by Ordo Magica and is a tradition whose practitioners are well-versed in the mysteries of fire, the will's triumph over matter and the labyrinths of the senses. To wizards of the Order, these phenomena are intimately connected.

#### Novice 
**Special**. The wizard no longer suffers permanent Corruption when learning powers at novice level belonging to the tradition of Wizardry, nor when learning its rituals. Despite this, the character has no protection against the temporary Corruption that comes from using the powers and rituals of Wizardry.
#### Adept
**Special**. The wizard no longer suffers Corruption from learning the adept level of the powers belonging to the tradition of Wizardry. The adept has also learned to ground the powers and rituals of Wizardry in theories so well that the character now only suffers one (1) temporary Corruption when casting them.
#### Master
**Special**. The master wizard's understanding of linked magic is all but complete and the player character may therefore re-roll one (1) failed test each turn when attempting to establish a Chain of mystical effects (see page 130). The wizard no longer suffers permanent Corruption from learning the master level of the powers belonging to the tradition of Wizardry.
