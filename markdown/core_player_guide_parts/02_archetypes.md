## Archetypes

THIS CHAPTER DESCRIBES the archetypes that the player may use as a starting point when creating a character. Together the Warrior, Mystic and Rogue archetypes cover the most common functions needed for combat and problem-solving in a group of adventurers. Each archetype is exemplified by five occupations and each occupation comes with suggestions on suitable Attributes and Abilities.

### Warrior

> "Here you got twin blade-wielding goblins, barbarian axe dancers, ogre pit fighters and fully armored knights ofthe finest stock -pick one ofthem to give you your first painful lesson!"
>
> -- *Agna Trollslayer, Sword Master in Thistle Hold.*

The barbarian clans of Davokar and the kingdom of Ambria house many traditions of war and combat. Some Warriors are professionals – soldiers with a pragmatic point of view, regarding warfare as a vocation. Others stem from noble families and bloodlines, and consider the glory of battle to be a part of their heritage. To some the art of war is nothing more than a method needed to survive, while others use their prowess in battle for a higher purpose, such as serving Prios the Sun God or restoring family honor lost during The Great War.

Regardless of culture and origins, the Warrior's main arena is the battlefield, where he or she often assumes the role of a heavily armed shock trooper. The Warrior can also contribute to effective problem-solving, mainly through their capacity to lead.

#### WARRIORS AND THE RACES

Ogres are commonly considered to be the exemplary Warrior, closely followed by humans. Changelings are seldom regarded as classical Warrior material, and the same goes for goblins. You can definitely find Warriors among changelings and goblins, but these tend to rely on agility and finesse rather than on raw physical strength. 

#### Warrior Attributes

A Warrior's primary Attribute is Strong, followed by Accurate and Quick – it is of course necessary for a Warrior to endure pain and damage, to have true aim and to swiftly seize the initiative. Beyond that, it is a question of whether the Warrior is a leader (Persuasive), resilient against mystical powers (Resolute) or especially aware of his or her surroundings (Vigilant).

#### WARRIOR ABILITIES

Warriors are usually a rough and hardy lot, yet some have more of a tactical mind and many are strong leaders. Finesse is rarely the trademark of a Warrior but there are definitely those among them who take pride not just in winning, but also in how they win.

The following abilities are often found in a Warrior's arsenal, sorted according to Attributes.
- **Accurate:** Polearm Mastery, Shield Fighter, Twin Attack, Two-handed Force
- **Persuasive:** Dominate, Leader
- **Quick:** Acrobatics, Quickdraw
- **Resolute:** Bodyguard, Steadfast
- **Strong:** Iron Fist, Steadfast
- **General:** Berserker, Equestrian, Exceptional Attribute, Man-at-arms, Recovery


#### BERSERKER
>"Keep your distance! I wouldn't want to hurt you."

Spirits of rage follow you and fill you with uncontrolled ferocity in battle. When you are not in combat you are of a thoughtful and patient disposition, a contrast that makes you both appreciated and feared. The barbarians speak of the Guard of the Slumbering Wrath, a handpicked group ofberserkers serving as the High Chieftain's bodyguard -do you dream of joining their ranks, or do you seek to defeat one of them as revenge for taking your place among them?

- **Important Attributes:** Strong 13+, Quick 11+
- **Suggested race:** Barbarian or ogre
- **Appropriate abilities:** Berserker, Iron Fist, Recovery, Two-handed Force

#### DUELIST
>"Please. refrain from bleeding on me when I run you through."

Honor and glory is everything for a Warrior, and even better if one can defend their name with some flair. You have been living your life guided by that code and the fact that you are still alive undoubtedly speaks well of your talent.
- **Important Attributes:** Accurate 13+, Quick or Discreet 11+
- **Suggested race:** Ambrian or changeling
- **Appropriate abilities:** Acrobatics, Feint, Man-at-arms, Twin Attack

#### CAPTAIN
> "Everything will work out fine -just follow my lead!"

You are a natural born leader and have built your military career on that. Swordplay is only a way to keep yourself alive and maybe gain the respect of your subordinates at the same time. You bring out the best in your allies, guiding and protecting them so you can achieve your military goals. That is how you gain their trust.
- **Important Attributes:** Persuasive 13+
- **Suggested race:** Human (usually Ambrian)
- **Appropriate abilities:** Dominate, Leader, Man-at-arms, Shield Fighter

#### SELLSWORD
> "My sword and my life, in exchange for you gold."

Fighting has been a way of life for you -for payment. The lords of Ambria often employ hired swords in their campaigns against the barbarians oftDavokar, while the clan leaders of Davokar do the same in return. Merchants need guards, as do pilgrims. You may have fought for different masters over the years, but the key to your survival has always been your skill and an instinct for judging what battles can or cannot be won.
- **Important Attributes:** Strong 13+
- **Suggested race:** Human
- **Appropriate abilities:** Iron Fist, Man-at-arms, Polearm Mastery, Shield Fighter

#### KNIGHT
> "You may take my life, but not my honor."

You are a knight who fights to break the enemy's lines or to hold your own. Heavily armored on the .outside and with a deep sense of duty on the inside, you fight for the favor of your lord, the lives of your allies or your own glory. Maybe you dream of one day becoming a member of the Queen's royal guard or a Templar fighting in the name of Prios.
- **Important Attributes:** Strong 13+, Quick 11+
- **Suggested race:** Ambrian
- **Appropriate abilities:** Bodyguard, Iron Fist, Man-at-arms, Two-handed Force


### Mystic
>"Each time you light a candle you also create a shadow."
>
> -- *Seldonio, Grand Master of Ordo Magica*

THERE ARE MANY SOURCES of mystical power in the world. These can be tapped by one who understands the underlying laws of nature or through alliances with either the light of the heavens, the spirits of the forest or the darkness of corruption. Some Mystics consider themselves to be scholars of reality and existence; others would claim they are part of a pact that offers them an intimate relationship with the source of their power.

#### MYSTICS AND THE RACES

Changelings and humans dominate the domain of the mystical, at least according to public opinion. The stories of the witches of the barbarian clans are spread far and wide and it is near impossible not to notice the Ordo Magica of Ambria. The theurgs of the Light are a less obvious group since they tend to keep to the temples or move among the faithful, but the Lawgiver is known to bless some of his champions with extraordinary powers.

Mystics among the goblins are shamans, bound to no mystic tradition but earning high status among their own kind with their home-brewed theories regarding the world and its spirits. Changelings often have the mystical gift -those who grow up among the barbarians are sent away to train with the witches, while changelings in the slums of Ambria become self-taught mystics without any specific tradition. Ogres with the mystical gift may seem like a rarity, but Ordo Magic a has documented at least a few cases since the Ambrians arrived in the region.

#### MYSTIC ATTRIBUTES

Mystics hold a strong mind in high regard (Resolute), and among witches it is the will of the individual that decides if they are to be accepted as apprentices or not. To the mages of Ordo Magica classical education (Cunning) is just as important and the theurges of Prios are often considered as having a strong personality (Persuasive). Mystics trained outside these traditions are often armed with a tremendous willpower, just like sorcerers, who also have extensive experience in how to not attract any unwanted attention (Discreet).

#### MYSTIC ABILITIES

Many Mystics, though not all of them, possess abilities tied to the traditions of Wizardry, Sorcery, Theurgy or Witchcraft. Furthermore, even if most Mystics are associated with wisdom and learning, there are those who are drawn to the art of war and who have developed abilities for using mystical powers in battle.

The following abilities are common among Mystics, sorted according to Attributes.
- **Accurate:** Natural Warrior, Polearm Mastery
- **Cunning:** Alchemy, Beast Lore, Loremaster, Medicus
- **Persuasive:** Dominate, Leader
- **Quick:** Acrobatics
- **Resolute:** Mystical Power, Steadfast
- **Strong:** Steadfast
- **Vigilant:** Sixth Sense, Witchsight
- **General:** Berserker, Exceptional Attribute, Wizardry, Recovery, Ritualist, Sorcery, Theurgy, Witchcraft

#### WITCH
> "Your will is inferior to the will of Nature. Accept it! Or die."

Your home is the wilds; to balance your own needs with the ones of nature is your calling. As a witch you have a strong connection to the land itself and can add its primal powers to your inner strength. You negotiate with the spirits of nature, understand theflow and needs of the land, and your powers are derived from the circle of life and death.
- **Important Attributes:** Resolute 13+, Accurate 11+
- **Suggested race:** Barbarian or changeling
- **Appropriate abilities:** Mystical Power, Natural Warrior, Ritualist, Witchcraft

#### SORCERER
> "There is another way, an easier way ... "

Driven by desperation or a lust for power, you walk the path of sorcery and will soon find yourselfboth touched by Corruption and hunted by fanatical witchhunters. Maybe you perceive your vulnerability as a proof of your need to grow even more powerful? Or are you truly remorseful and seeks a way back to forgiveness and salvation?
- **Important Attributes:** Resolute 13+, Discreet or Cunning 11+
- **Suggested race:** Human
- **Appropriate abilities:** Alchemy, Mystical Power, Ritualist, Sorcery

#### THEURG
> "Prios sees thee, heretic!"

You are a theurg, a priest with mystical powers. Your faith in the Lawgiver is unwavering: Prios is the sun and the light of the soul, the One who saved mankind from the bondage of the Old Gods, the creator of the world and protector of all life. From this pure spring flows extraordinary power. Your mystical knowledge would have been aimless and dangerous without your faith as a compass and foundation, as is often shown when godless Mystics wield their powers.
- **Important Attributes:** Resolute 13+, Cunning or Vigilant 11+
- **Suggested race:** Ambrian
- **Appropriate abilities:** Medicus, Mystical Power, Ritualist, Theurgy

#### WIZARD
> "Remarkable, this must be brought back for further research!"

You are schooled in the secrets of the old magic of the Order, wisdoms born in the southern kingdom and refined by a millennium ofresearch and education. To you, mystical powers are an extension of the fundamental laws of the world, laws that you have studied carefully and know how to use for effects both grand and impressive.
- **Important Attributes:** Resolute 13+, Cunning 11+
- **Suggested race:** Ambrian
- **Appropriate abilities:** Loremaster, Mystical Power, Ritualist, Wizardry

#### Self-taught Mystic
"> They said that I didn't take my powers seriously; I'll show them how wrong they were."

You are a self-taught mystic, excluded from the traditions, never accepted by your peers or completely uninterested in the narrow worldviews they offer. However, your freedom comes at a price: corruption is lurking around each corner and you are fair game to witchhunters and Black Cloaks. Whether you wander from village to village or hide in a bustling city, you probably earn your living by offering your services as an occult consultant or a finder of misplaced objects.
- **Important Attributes:** Resolute 13+, Vigilant 11+
- **Suggested race:** Ambrian or changeling
- **Appropriate abilities:** Mystical Power (any two), Ritualist, Witchsight

### Rogue
> "Treasure hunters, pathfinders, thugs, diplomats, swindlers, innkeepers, spies -all ofthem rogues!"
> 
> -- *Radomei Dalg, bitter guard captain in Yndaros.*

IN AMBRIA THE WORD "rogue" is used broadly and refers to all who "steal" something from others, be it their trust, secrets, money or life. The calling of the Warrior, to proudly face the opponent face-to-face, is an exception to this rule: it is the sneaky assassin that counts among the thieving Rogues. In essence, warriors, craftsmen and scholars are the ideal occupations among the Ambrians; the rest are more or less regarded as rogues.

#### ROGUES AND THE RACES

People at large would say that changelings and goblins are synonymous with rogues, and are usually surprised when they realize that ogres and humans can also be found amongst their number.

#### ROGUE ATTRIBUTES

Craftiness (Cunning) or reflexes (Quick) are what keep most Rogues alive. While discretion is never out of place in their line of work, it is far from their most prominent feature; instead a certain amount of curiosity about the outside world (Vigilant) is usually found among them. Some Rogues even find that the best life insurance is a smooth tongue and witty remarks (Persuasive).

#### ROGUE ABILITIES

Rogues usually have more than one string to their bow and many tend to be versatile rather than specialized. Two characters might share a common field but remain different from one another based on their chosen abilities. What Rogues do have in common is that they prefer to surprise and use knowledge, cunning and skill to stack the odds in their favor.

The following abilities are common among Rogues, sorted according to Attributes.
- **Accurate:** Marksman, Natural Warrior, Polearm Mastery, Steel Throw, Twin-attack
- **Cunning:** Alchemy, Beast Lore, Medicus, Poisoner, Loremaster, Strangler, Tactician
- **Discreet:** Backstab, Feint
- **Persuasive:** Dominate, Leader
- **Quick:** Acrobatics, Quick Draw
- **Resolute:** Steadfast
- **Strong:** Steadfast
- **Vigilant:** Sixth Sense, Witchsight
- **General:** Equestrian, Exceptional Attribute, Recovery, Ritualist

#### CHARLATAN
> "Two drops a day and you'll never be ill again!"

You have chosen the social arena as your battlefield. There, your quick tongue is your sharpest weapon and your confidence-inspiring eyes your best shield. If these should fail, then you had better trust in your light weapons and sneaky moves.
- **Important Attributes:** Quick 13+, Discreet 11+
- **Suggested race:** Human (usually Ambrian) or changeling
- **Appropriate abilities:** Acrobatics, Backstab, Feint, TwinAttack

#### WITCHHUNTER
> "I'd rather put an innocent in the dirt than have a blight beast walk upon it."

You have dedicated your life to fighting blight beasts, maybe as a consequence of having your own life torn apart by the growing and infectious darkness: a farm burned to the ground, the grave of your family, a friend's horrendous transformation -something that reminds you of what will happen if the power of the blighted ones is not broken in time. You will stop at nothing in your fight against evil: you wield steel, fire and maybe even rituals learned from defeated sorcerers. You realize that the use of mystical powers may ultimately corrupt you too, but you turn a blind eye to that and instead fight on with the fervor of the fanatic.
- **Important Attributes:** Resolute 13+, Cunning or Accurate 11+
- **Suggested race:** Human
- **Appropriate abilities:** Beast Lore, Marksman, Ritualist, Steadfast

#### THUG
> "Your money or your blood -your choice!"

The eastern districts oftYndaros are a wilderness as dangerous as Davokar, and just as rewarding for those who know how to harvest its fruits. You grew up on streets whose gangs have taught you the art of making a profit from others' hard work, right under the noses of the city watch. Other thugs rise through the ranks by becoming employed by barons or counts, free to act as ruffians and enforcers without being bothered by the Queen's watchmen.
- **Important Attributes:** Quick 13+, Cunning 11+
- **Suggested race:** Human, ogre or goblin
- **Appropriate abilities:** Acrobatics, Poisoner, Strangler, TwinAttack

#### TREASURE-HUNTER
> "This altar ... I wonder if you can't push it sideways ... "

The depths ofDavokar hide many treasures; to locate, salvage and return them to civilization is your bread and butter. You dream of overgrown ruins and fantasize about sunken temples. Unlike many others, you have proven yourself willing to risk your life in order to succeed. You have developed an impressive set of skills in order to do just that and there are few situations within Davokar for which you have not prepared a strategy.
- **Important Attributes:** Cunning 13+, Quick 11+
- **Suggested race:** Human, ogre or goblin
- **Appropriate abilities:** Acrobatics, Alchemy, Steel Throw, Tactician

#### RANGER
> "Anything that lives can be tracked. And brought down ... "

Your home is in the deep forest or the mountain valley, where you hunt beasts for food and fur or to protect inhabitants and travelers from harm. You have learned how to stay clear of your enemies' reach while your arrows still find their mark.
- **Important Attributes:** Vigilant 13+, Discreet 11+
- **Suggested race:** Barbarian or changeling
- **Appropriate abilities:** Acrobatics, Beast Lore, Marksman, Sixth Sense
