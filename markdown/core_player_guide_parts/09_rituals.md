## Rituals

RITUALS ARE TIME-CONSUMING spells that take at least one hour to perform. If properly used, a ritual can be a powerful problem-solving tool. Each tradition has developed a variety of distinctive practices and it can be difficult for members of other traditions to acquire the knowledge of specific rituals.

Like powers, rituals can cause Corruption; first when they are learned and then each time they are used. Each tradition has developed their own way of handling Corruption that comes from the use rituals, just like with the Corruption originating from using powers. Independent mystics lack the appropriate schooling and are therefore in an especially tough spot when it comes to suffering Corruption from all forms of mystical practices.

### BLOOD BOND

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

The corrupting effect of magic is of course well known to mystics. Sometimes the Corruption is a necessary price to pay in order to succeed with whatever task the mystic has undertaken. In the same way, the tainting of a familiar can be a necessary sacrifice for the mystic to be able to continue serving its people or its calling.

By using this bond ofblood, the mystic can share Corruption with its familiar. The mystic has to make a Resolute test whenever a Blood Bond ritual is attempted. A successfully performed ritual decreases the mystic's permanent Corruption by 1D4 points, and increases the familiars permanent Corruption by 1D6. The familiar suffers all the usual signs of corruption. Should the familiar turn into an abomination the mystic loses control and is immediately attacked by its former companion.

The ritual costs one (1) Experience to perform, whether it is successful or not. The mystic cannot perform the ritual for someone else.


### BORROW BEAST

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

By performing this ritual the mystic can possess the body of a small beast and have full control over it for a long period of time. The mystic's body is in a trance during the duration of the ritual. The mystic's mind is thrown back to its own body if the borrowed body is harmed. The same happens if the mystic's body is harmed or exposed to some kind of powerful interference (like being shoved, drenched in water or affected by heat and smoke).

A mystic can manage to remain in this trance for 24 hours, after which the mind returns to its body. After this, Borrow Beast cannot be performed again for a time period which is as long as the previous trance lasted.

A mystic who performs Borrow Beast and lets its body rest inside a Witch Circle has no limitation as to how long it can maintain the trance, since the body gets all the nutrition it needs from the ground inside the circle.

### BREAK LINK

**Tradition:** Wizardry

The mystic can break any current mystical links and bonds to an object or a person by trapping the target in a circle of mystical runes and making a successful Resolute test. The magic of the object is not affected but the target can no longer be reached with rituals like Heretic's Trailand Summoning. In addition, any mystical bonds that may have been created by people visiting the location are negated, which can be used to prevent others from using Clairvoyanceand Seven-league Strideto view or reach the location until they have visited the location again. Finally, Break Link can be used to cut the bond between a creature and a mystical artifact (see more on artifacts on page 186).

### CLAIRVOYANCE

**Tradition:** Wizardry

By using this ritual the mystic can observe and listen in on a faraway location, provided that the mystic has personally visited that location before. People at that location with the Witchsight ability can realize that they are being watched if they make a successful [Resolute<-Discreet] test. Clairvoyance is blocked by the rituals Sanctum, Sanctifying Rite and Witch Circle.

### COMMAND CONFESSION

**Tradition:** Theurgy

The ritual forces a victim to truthfully answer a number of yes/no questions asked by the mystic. Each question requires a [Resolute<-ResoluteJ test, and the ritual is disrupted as soon as a test fails. The mystic may not continue to interrogate the victim after that, at least not through the use of this ritual.

### DESECRATING RITE

**Tradition:** Sorcery

The mystic desecrates a specific site, tainting it and in effect punishing those who try to affect it from outside. A desecrated location corrupts those who use rituals like Clairvoyance, Summoning or Heretic's Trail on it. The desecration gives 1D6 temporary Corruption to those who perform said rituals and if they persist in trying to get information with rituals they will also suffer 1D6 permanent Corruption.

Abominations (creatures belonging to the Abomination monster category) and the undead are drawn to desecrated areas and heal 1D4 points of Toughnessfor each hour they remain on desecrated ground. Even creatures that are only tainted by corruption, but have not transformed into true abominations, feel a strong attraction to desecrated areas and objects.

The Desecrating Rite can also be performed over a weapon, which is a requirement for the Revenant Strike power.

### ENSLAVE

**Tradition:** Sorcery

The mystic can use this ritual to enslave a creature. The enslavement is linked to a slave rune, carved into the skin somewhere on the victim (usually forehead, chest or neck).

The slave rune and its effect can be revealed by someone using the Witchsight ability or the Holy Smoke ritual.

The power of the slave rune may be broken with either Break Link or Exorcism. It is also possible to physically remove the rune from the victim, but not without inflicting 1D6 points of damage and 1D4 points of permanent Corruption. The slave will fight to remain in slavery.

The creature is not controlled by the mystic in every detail, but it will obey the mystic blindly to the best of its ability. The slave can partially reflect upon its situation, cry when it acts against its old nature and so on, but can in no way resist the mystic's latest command.

### EXCHANGE SHADOW

**Tradition:** Sorcery

The mystic can exchange its Shadow with that of another creature by making a successful [Resolute<-Resolute] test: the mystic's Shadow looks like the creature's Shadow and vice versa. The ritual is active for 24 hours and requires a link to the victim for the mystic to even be able to attempt the exchange: a lock of hair, a splash of blood or an item which is important to the target. The target does not notice the switch but those who can see Shadows can of course perceive it (or be tricked by it). Exchange Shadow can be negated by Break Link or Exorcism.

### EXORCISM

**Tradition:** Theurgy 

The mystic can banish a spirit possessing a creature or person. The mystic gets three attempts to succeed with a {Resolute<-Resolute] test; the test's resistance being the Resolute of the possessing spirit. It only takes one successful test to banish the possessing force. If all three tests should fail, the spirit possesses the mystic instead.

### FALSE TERRAIN

**Tradition:** Wizardry 

The mystic can weave an illusion over a location and completely hide what is truly there. Any creature that comes close can see through the illusion with a successful {Resolute<-Resolute] test. Any creature that either touches or passes through the illusion will, of course, automatically see through the deception. The illusion remains, even if revealed, but fades over time, if not maintained monthly by someone renewing the ritual.

### FAMILIAR

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

The mystic binds itself to a beast. This beast is not much smarter than others of its kind, but is fiercely loyal to the mystic and the bond between them is made up of mystical energies -they are soul mates. The spiritual bond is so strong that the two can communicate telepathically; the mystic can command the familiar from a distance and also experience whatever the familiar perceives with its senses. The depth of this union also makes it possible for the two to share wounds. If the familiar is wounded the mystic can choose to suffer half of the damage, or if the mystic is wounded half of the damage can be transferred to the familiar. The player decides when damage should be shared in this way. There is also a downside to the mystical bond: should the familiar die the mystic suffers m8 points of damage, ignoring Armor.

The familiar is managed by the player as if it was an additional character. It gains Experienceas a player character, but loses it if it dies (no death tests allowed).

> #### FAMILIAR
> A familiar starts with the following statistics, or something similar depending on what seems suitable for the character's bestial friend:
> | | |
> |-|-
> | **Traits**        | Armored (I), Natural Weapon (I)
> | **Attributes**    | Accurate 11, Persuasive 5, Cunning 7, Discreet 9, Quick 13, Resolute 10, Strong 15, Vigilant 10
> | **Weapons**       | Tusks 1D6 (short)
> | **Defense**       | 13(Dodge)
> | **Armor**         | Animal skin 1D4 (flexible)
> | **Toughness**     | 15  
> | **Pain Threshold** | 8

### FLAMING SERVANT

**Tradition:** Wizardry 

The mystic awakens a fierce fire creature and binds it to a suit of metal (medium or heavy armor). The servant then walks by the mystic's side like a smoldering and steaming bodyguard, which flares up and turns into a burning warrior in battle. The mystic can only have one Flaming Servant bound to itself at any time, and if the Flaming Servant perishes in battle, then the suit of armor needs to be repaired by a blacksmith in order for the ritual to be placed on that same armor again.

The Flaming Servant is handled by the player as ifit was an additional character. It gains Experience as a player character, but loses it ifit dies (no death tests allowed).

> #### FLAMING SERVANT
> A Flaming Servant starts with the following statistics:
> | | |
> |-|-
> | Attributes    | Accurate 13, Persuasive 5, Cunning 7. Discreet 9, Quick 11, Resolute 10, Strong 15, Vigilant 10
> | Weapons       | Burning sword 1D8
> | Defense       | 9 (Shield)
> | Armor         | Smoldering scale mail 1D6 (impeding)
> | Toughness     | 15  
> | Pain Threshold | 8

### FORTUNE-TELLING

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

With a successful Resolute test, the mystic may ask a yes/no question regarding the adventure. Fortune-telling can only be done once per adventure, and further attempts are only possible when something major has come to pass, potentially changing the future (the Game Master decides if such an event has occurred).

> **The Chapter Circles of Ordo Magica**
> 
> Each chapter of Ordo Magica keeps a magic circle and these are more or less always manned by a bored and/or studying novice, making it possible to always reach the chapter telepathically.
> 
> Magic circles are the only place where a Seven-league Stride can land, but there are also other criteria to be met (see Seven-league Stride).
> 
> A Telepathic Interrogation can be done through a magic circle, which is one of the reasons why wizards are generally reluctant to overuse telepathic communication, especially with mystics that they do not know very well. Even with trusted colleagues transmissions are kept as short as possible -on the crowded career ladder of Ordo Magica there is no room to give even a close friend any competitive advantage, if you can avoid it.
> 
> Magic circles must be made physically manifest and can be destroyed by ruining the circle's physical form. The circles of Ordo Magica are usually chiseled into the stone floor and are then inlaid with silver, and yet such a circle can be destroyed in a minute if one has the right tools. It is fully possible to form a temporary circle of sand, but it is easily destroyed by just a couple of careless steps.

### HERETIC'S TRAIL

**Tradition:** Theurgy 

With a successful Resolutetest the mystic cantrack an abomination or a taintedcreature that the mystic has met personally. The tracking is impeccable until the blighted one crosseswater -ifitdoes,the ritualmustbeperformedagain on the farside ofthe stream. Should the test fail, the mystic cannot try again until the next day. Also, it is harder to track blight-strickencreatureswithinlargersettlements and in Davokar, giving the mystic a second chance of failing the test;the player mustroll twice and if one of those fails, so does the ritual.

### HOLY SMOKE

**Tradition:** Theurgy 

The mystic can reveal blight-stricken persons or creatures byusing incense and making a successful Cunning test. The smoke spreads among those present and gathers around objects andcreatures in relation to how corrupted they are: the closer the smoke gathers, the more tainted the creature in question is. The Game Master clearly states if objects or creatures are blight-stricken, blightmarked or thoroughly corrupt.

Holy Smoke can be countered by the Exchange Shadow ritual.

### ILLUSION

**Tradition:** Wizardry 

The mystic creates a false image. This image can move andspeak butdissolves iftouched by intelligent creatures. The image is completely real until then;itboth sounds,smells andappearsdangerous. Yet,the image can neitherharm nor affect physical objects. The Illusion can only perform simple tasks such as guarda location or go towards a village and howl. The effect is active for one scene or one hour if not dissolved before then.

### JUDGING BONDS

**Tradition:** Theurgy 

The mystic lets pacifyinglightflowthrough chains or shackles holding a person. This prevents the shackled person from using mystical powers and traits that require a Resolute test. The light evaporates from the shackles over time, so the effect must be maintained by a renewed ritual each month.

### MAGIC CIRCLE

**Tradition:** Wizardry 

The mystic establishes a permanentmagical circle which can be used to communicate telepathically withpersons in other known magical circles. Only mystics with the Magic Circle ritual can initiate telepathic communication with anothercircle, but anyone can receive such a transmission.

The mystic needs not have visited these other circles to be able to communicate with them, but must know with certainty that there is another circle at a specific location to be able to reach it. Theremust also be a person in thereceiving circle for communication to be possible. All who stand within a receiving Magic Circle are aware of and may participate inthe communication; one cannot discriminate between recipients.

### NATURE'S LULLABY

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

By making a successful Resolute test the mystic can sing an aspect of dark Davokar to sleep, and can therefore pass by a specific abomination without itreacting -the mystic andits allies becomesmore or less invisible to the blighted creature.

If the mystic or its allies behave aggressively, then the effect of the ritual is broken. The same happens if the mystic stops singing, to use a mystical power for example.

### NECROMANCY

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

The mystic can ask a dead person a number of questions, either by sitting next to its body (just a skull will do, as well) or its grave. Each question demands a successful Resolutetest, and the dead answers either 'yes' or 'no' by knocking: one knock for 'no' and two for 'yes'. In the case of a failure the mystic can still try to force an answer from the dead, but at the risk of becoming possessed by the spirit; roll [Resolute<-Resolute]. If the test is failed the mystic becomes possessed and is forced to perform the last wish of the dead, often ofa vengeful nature.

### ORACLE

**Tradition:** Theurgy 

A successful roll against Resolute allows the mystic to ask an open question about the future of the ongoing adventure. This ritual can only be used once per adventure, regardless of what happens. The Game Master's answer must be truthful, but not necessary easily interpreted or too revealing.

### PATRON SAINT

**Tradition:** Theurgy The mystic is accompanied by a guardian spirit, the soul of a fallen Templar given the mission to once again serve one of the Sun God's chosen. The martyr manifests as a warrior oflight that normally is invisible but starts to shine when danger is close, and protects its ward until its second death. Only one Patron Saint can be bound to a mystic at a time, and should the saint be defeated a new one must be summoned.

A Patron Saint is handled by the player as if it was an additional character. It gains Experienceas a player character, but loses it if it dies (no death tests allowed).

> #### PATRON SAINT
> A Patron Saint has the trait Spirit Form (I), and starts with the following statistics:
> | | |
> |-|-|
> | Attributes    | Accurate 13, Persuasive 5, Cunning 7, Discreet 9, Quick 15, Resolute 10, Strong 11, Vigilant 10
> | Weapons       | Flail of light 1D6
> | Defense       | 15 (Dodge)
> | Armor         | Half damage (see Spirit Form I)
> | Toughness     | 11 
> | Pain Threshold | 6


> ##### On Patron Saints
>
> Patron Saints cannot be equipped with other weapons and armor from the start. If the saint uses its experience to gain an Ability related to some kind of weapon the Light Flail transforms accordingly.

> ##### Companions in Combat
>
> When an encounter or combat scene suggests a quantity of opponents based on the number of player chatracters (e.g. [PC+2] Robbers), companions such as a Familiar, Flaming Servant or Patron Saint should be counted among the characters. This also pertains to longstanding NPCs who are effectively members of the adventuring party (e.g. guides, expedition leaders, hired sellswords), so long as they are equipped to affect the outcome of the fight.


### POSSESS

**Tradition:** Sorcery 

By performing this ritual, and making a successful [Resolute<-Resolute] test, the mystic can possess a creature's body and control it completely for a limited time (up to 24 hours). The ritual requires a link to the victim for the mystic to even be able to attempt the possession: a lock of hair, a splash of blood or an item that is important to the intended victim. The victim recalls everything that happens during the possession, but sees these events more as a surreal dream than an actual memory. The victim cannot be made to commit suicide while possessed, but can otherwise be made to go against all its principles.

The possession can be observed as a change in the Shadow, as the victim gains the Shadow of the mystic. The possession can be broken by either ExorcismorBreak Link. If done by using Exorcism,the mystic cannot possess the same creature ever again.

The mystic's own body remains in a trance during the possession. If the borrowed body is killed during the possession then the mystic's mind and spirit are thrown back into its own body. The same happens if the mystic's body is harmed or exposed to some kind of powerful interference (like being shoved, drenched in water or affected by heat and smoke, etc.).

### PURGING FIRE

**Tradition:** Theurgy 

Corruption is extra dreadful to theurgs, since it represents the foremost proof of the power of darkness. Most theurgs do their utmost to not be tainted by Corruption, and should they fail they can always learn the ritual called Purging Fire.

When performing the ritual, the mystic prepares itself with song and prayers before climbing onto a burning pyre to cleanse its body of Corruption. For each turn the theurg stands in the fire, it suffers m6 damage, and if a [Resolute<-Damage] test is passed, one (1) point of permanent Corruption is removed. If the test fails, the mystic throws itself from the pyre and the ritual is interrupted.

Performing the ritual costs one (1) point of Experience, whether it is successful or not. The mystic cannot perform the ritual for someone else; only he or she who performs the ritual may benefit from the purifying effect.

### QUICK GROWTH

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

The mystic can have a seed grow into a full sized plant by using this ritual. The form of the plant is partially under the control of the mystic, and a tree can become a bridge or smash a gate to splinters. However, the mystic has no control over the seasons; the plant takes the form that it naturally has during the current season. The location where this seed is planted must meet the conditions required for the plant to grow to full size under natural circumstances. In other words, an oak cannot be planted in a dark cave without light and soil, but maybe vines can take root there and grow into lianas for people to climb.

In a Witch Circle created by the same mystic, the ritual Quick Growth can be performed regardless of the season.


### SANCTIFYING RITE

**Tradition:** Theurgy

The mystic sanctifies a location, thereby shielding it from outside mystical influence. A sacred location blocks rituals like Clairvoyance, Summoning, Heretic's Trail and the like, but should any of these rituals be tracking or hunting a person the block is gone as soon as the person leaves the sacred area.

Abominations (creatures that are members of the Abomination monster category) feel sick when getting close to an area that has been sanctified, and suffer 1D4 damage that ignores Armor each turn they remain on holy ground. Creatures that are tainted but have not yet turned into a true abomination experience a strong discomfort when around sacred locations and objects.

Sanctifying Rite can also be performed over a weapon, which is a requirement for the Witch Hammerpower.

### SANCTUM

**Tradition:** Wizardry

The mystic can use this ritual to cover a location (one large or a couple of smaller rooms) in a magical shroud, making it impossible to peek inside or disturb it from outside with mystical powers. Sanctum blocks the effect oftrituals like Clairvoyance, Summoning or Heretic's Trail, but should any of these rituals be tracking or hunting a person the block is gone as soon as the person leaves the Sanctum.

If there is a Magic Circle within an area affected by Sanctum (regardless of which was there first), then no one but the mystic who performed the Sanctum can use the circle for communication or for the purpose of performing a Seven-league Stride.

### SEVEN-LEAGUE STRIDE

**Tradition:** Wizardry

The mystic can create a temporary magic circle and use it to teleport itself and one of its allies standing in the circle to another Magic Circle that is well known to the mystic. A circle is considered known when the mystic has visited its location and taken some time to study it.

### SOUL STONE

**Tradition:** Wizardry

Corruption was never a problem to wizards before The Great War, since their meticulous practices protected them from blackening their souls. During desperate moments of the war, the battle mages of Ordo Magica took increasingly greater risks in the name of necessity and thereby brought Corruption upon themselves. To counteract this evil they dusted off an ancient and shunned ritual, by which one can capture the soul of a dying creature in a crystal prepared for the purpose. That same ritual proved to work well in order to drain Corruption from a wizard and transfer it to the soul in the stone.

The ritual binds the mystic to the crystal, which then works as an extension of the wizard's soul. The ritual allows the mystic to move 1D4 points of permanent Corruption to the soul stone with a successful Resolutetest. The stone can hold up to half of the mystic's Resolute in Corruption; it darkens as it fills up and detonates if said limit is surpassed. The collected Corruption then rushes back to the mystic, often with a rather nasty result. In the unlikely case that he or she survives that wave of Corruption, it is possible for the mystic to bind itself to a new soul stone and start over.

The ritual costs one (1) point of Experience to perform, whether it is successful or not. A wizard that manages to learn the ritual receives a soul stone from its order chapter; other mystics must pay their own way. To buy a soul stone costs 100 thaler.

### SUMMONING

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

The mystic summons a creature by making a successful Resolutetest. The creature must then make its way to the location of the summoning. The mystic must have something in its possession related to the summoned creature, either an object of great value to the creature, or an actual part of it, such as a drop of blood or a lock of hair.

The summoned creature will try to reach the location to the best of its abilities but does not necessarily know why it wants to go there, other than following an irresistible calling. The only way to protect a creature that has been summoned is to trick and lure it to step inside a mystically shielded area (the Sanctifying Rite, Witch Circle or Sanctum rituals) or use the Break Link ritual.

### TALE OF ASHES

**Tradition:** Wizardry

The mystic can read the ashes of a burnt object and thereby discern what the object once was and what happened when it burned -the mystic experiences all impressions from the fire, sees who was there and hears what was being said. A campfire can have much to tell about what happened around it.

### TELEPATHIC INTERROGATION

**Tradition:** Wizardry

The mystic can stretch out its mind and read thoughts. The mystic can receive an answer to a yes/no question from the victim's subconscious by making a successful [Resolute<-Resolute] test. A failed test severs the telepathic connection and no further attempts can be made with that creature during the adventure. The mystic must touch its victim, and the victim can notice the mind-reading if the mystic fails a [Discreet<-Vigilant] test. Of course, a helpless and bound victim can do nothing to stop this, but other victims will react. Sleeping victims wake up if the test fails.

### TURN WEATHER

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

The mystic alters the local weather as he or she sees fit. Fog that obscures one's view, storms that prevent trips or the calming of such storms are all possible to achieve. The ritual takes one hour to perform and the effect remains active for half a day; after that the local weather returns to its natural form.

### WITCH CIRCLE

**Tradition:** Witchcraft

The mystic breathes new life into a beautiful location and turns it into a witch circle. Witch circles are protected from prying eyes and influences from outside, and the mystic has more or less complete control over what happens within the circle. The mystic decides how things grow and which season it is within, and can with the Quick Growth ritual create an environment to mirror its heart's delight.

It is hard to find a Witch Circle, even if you know where to look for it. It requires a [Vigilant<-Discreet] test to even see the circle if encountered in the wilderness. Creatures that do not see the circle will simply walk around it, without knowing they have taken a short detour.

A mystic with both the Witch Circle ritual and the Alchemy ability can make an extra attempt at Alchemy tests when using the ability inside its circle. A mystic with Quick Growth, Witch Circle and Alchemy can make two extra attempts when using Alchemy.

A mystic who performs Borrow Beast and lets its body rest inside a Witch Circle has no limitation as to how long it can maintain the trance, since its body gets all the nutrition it needs from the ground inside the circle.
