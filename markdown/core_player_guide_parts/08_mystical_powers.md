## Mystical Powers

MYSTICAL POWERS are a manifestation of mystic energies that have been manipulated and guided by a trained or talented will. For some, these powers come naturally, as a gift of birth, but in most cases the powers are developed through many hard years of working together with a patient master, there to guide and make corrections. Whether the powers are a result of a gift, studies or dedication, they tend to define their users as much as being a tool in their hands.

THE FOLLOWING TERMS and rules are important when using powers in the world of Symbaroum.

**Ongoing Effect**: The effect of the power is active until the character fails a specific test, detailed in the description of the power. This test is repeated every turn on the character's Initiative. Keeping an ongoing effect running counts as a Free Action.

**Ongoing Effect on Group**: The power affects each target until the character fails a specific test, detailed in the description of the power. This test is made for each target and repeated every turn on the character's Initiative. Keeping an ongoing effect running counts as a Free Action.

**Chain**: The power may potentially hit more than one target, but a test has to be made for each target, one at a time, in an order decided by the player. The Chain continues until the player fails a test.

**Concentration**: If a mystic suffers damage while using a power with a potentially ongoing effect, he or she must make a successful roll against [Resolute<-Damage] in order to stay focused. A test is made for every attack that hits the mystic and for every power that is ongoing at the moment. If the mystic fails any of these tests, then the ongoing effects of all powers are ended. In this case damage refers to the damage that the mystic suffers after the Armor value has been subtracted.

**Corruption**: Permanent Corruption is the corruption that eats away at one's soul and cannot be washed away with anything but purging rituals. Temporary Corruption diminishes over time and disappears completely at the end of a scene. A character's Total Corruption is the sum ofboth its temporary and permanent Corruption. The Total Corruption is used to estimate just how affected the character is by the Corruption.

**Material**: The description of powers sometimes lists either materials or an object. This is mainly intended to add flavor to the power, rather than being a strict requirement. If a player would rather have his character use another material instead of the suggested one, then he or she is of course allowed to make a change. An exception to this is powers that operate through the use of a weapon, in which case the weapon has to be available for the power to function. Holy /unholy symbols may be a sun symbol, an evil mark, a witch's medallion or a wizard's staff, for example.


### ANATHEMA

#### Master
**Active**. By making a successful Resolute test the mystic is now powerful enough to dispel all currently ongoing mystical effects, including summoned effects and creatures.

#### Novice
**Active**. The mystic can seize control of a creature s will by making a successful [Resolute<-Resolute] test.

#### Master 
**Active**. The mystic can seize control of a creature's will by making a successful [Resolute<-Resolute] test.

By faith and will, the mystic raises a holy shield against the weapons of its enemies. The shield is invisible until attacked, at which time it glitters as if struck by sunlight.
#### Novice
**Active**. With a successful roll against Resolute the mystic surrounds itself with a warm glow. This glow provides an additional 1D4 Armor.

#### Master
**Active**.The mystic unleashes a veritable storm of flaming and smoking energies. If the mystic passes a [Resolute<-Quick] test. the cascade deals 1D12 points of damage. If the mystic fail the test the cascade only deals 1D6 damage. Even if the mystic should fail a test the Chain does not stop; it continues to strike new oppenents until a second test is failed.

The mystic's understanding of the labyrinth of the senses can cause an enemy to lose itself inside its own mind. Confused enemies become paralyzed or lose their ability to separate friend from foe.
#### Novice
**Active**. The mystic can confuse an enemy with a successful [Resolute<-Resolute] test, making the enemy unaware of its actions. Roll 1D6 each turn until the mystic breaks concentration or fails a [Resolute<-Resolute] test: 1-2, the target stands still, blinking stupidly; 3-4, the target attacks whichever of its allies is closest; 5-6, the target attacks whichever of its enemies is closest. If there is any uncertainty regarding who is closest to the target, roll a die to decide.
#### Adept
**Active**. The mystic can confuse an enemy without having to concentrate. The Confusion is ongoing until the mystic fails a [Resolute<-Resolute] test. A new test must be made each turn.
#### Master

The mystic masters the stare of the Evil Eye and can curse enemies on the battlefield; a power often used by the disciples of the Dark Lords during The Great War.

#### Novice
**Active**. By rolling a successful Resolute test, the mystic calls forth entangling vines or roots from out of the earth and can ensnare an enemy. The ensnared creature cannot move but can use ranged weapons and powers. The creature is ensnared until the mystic fails a [Resolute<-Strong] test, starting the following turn.
#### Adept

It is possible to pass through the wall with an ordinary Movement Action, but all who do suffer 1D12 points of fire damage. Smaller flammable objects such as arrows and bolts are burned to cinder if shot through the burning wall. The wall can also be summoned directly on a group of enemies who are then automatically wounded, provided that the targets form a line in front of the mystic. The Flame Wall is sustained until the mystic fails a Resolute test, made once each turn after the first.
#### Adept
**Active**. The Flame Wall curves and closes into a burning circle around the mystic and its allies, as well as any enemy combatants within range of melee combat when this power is activated. The wall of flames can either be flown over or passed through, both with a Movement Action, but all who pass through the wall suffer 1D12 points of fire damage. The Flame Wall is sustained until the mystic fails a Resolute test, made once each turn after the first.
#### Master
**Active**. The Flame Wall curves and bends until it forms a burning dome that covers the mystic and its allies, as well as any enemy combatants within range of melee combat when this power is activated.

The wall of fire is sustained until the mystic fails a Resolute test, made once each turn after the first.

The mystic has grasped that physical appearance is a dynamic concept, and knows how to use that insight to transform its enemies into weaker forms.
#### Novice
**Active**. With a successful roll against Resolute the mystic can turn a target into a harmless beast (mammal or reptile, the mystic decides which). The target stays in that form until the mystic breaks concentration or fails a [Resolute<-Resolute] test. This test is made each turn on the mystic's Initiative. The harmless animal keeps the target's original Attributes but none of its abilities or powers and can neither attack nor use items.

### NATURE'S EMBRACE
**Material:**  A fistful of soil. 

The deep soil of the world is a safe place for the mystic, just as the mountain rock may become a shelter. The mystic can sink into the earth and thereby avoid attacks from its enemies.
#### Novice  
**Active**. The mystic is able to sink into the earth if a successful Resolute test is made. There, the mystic is invulnerable but also unable to take any Actions.

### REVENANT STRIKE
**Material:**  A weapon tainted by a Desecrating Rite. 

The mystic's weapon is touched by dark energies, which increases the damage dealt against living creatures. Worse, those slain will rise again, as walking corpses controlled by the sorcerer. Undead created by revenant strikes have the same statistics as the dragoul (see page 230). The undead returns to its state of true death at the end of the scene.

The mystic's understanding of the essence of naturemakes it possible to take the form ofbeasts -a talentthat the snake witches of clan Gaoia are particularlyrenowned for.
#### Novice
**Active**. With a successful Resolute test, the mystic can take the form of a small beast (mammal or reptile); practical when wanting to escape or when scouting, but useless in combat. The mystic's Attributes remain unchanged but he or she may re-roll all Discreet and Quicktests (including Defense). Also, enemies do not get any Free Attacks against the mystic when in beast form, even if it withdraws from melee combat or hurries past an enemy. The mystic does not have to test Resolute to remain in beast form, but has to pass a Resolute test to change back. For the duration of the transformation, the mystic counts as a beast. If the mystic becomes the victim of powers that affect beasts, then it may choose to remain in beast form -and hence suffer the effect of the power -or revert back to its original form.

### STORM ARROW 
**Material:**  Arrows or crossbow bolts.

#### Novice 
**Active**. The mystic enchants a handful of arrows (up to five) with a successful Resolute test. The arrows then float next to the mystic for the rest of the scene and can be fired, once per turn, as a Free Action(one arrow can be fired the same turn that the power is activated). The arrows hit their target automatically. Any quality or special ability that the arrow might have is added to the effect. The arrow normally deals 1D6 damage. 
#### Adept
**Active**. The arrows are enchanted as above, but in the hands of the adept mystic they now deal 1D8 damage. As a Combat Action, the mystic can send two arrows against either the same target or two different targets. If the mystic performs this Action, then he or she cannot fire another arrow as a Free Action.

#### Novice 
**Reaction**. With a [Resolute<-Resolute] test,the mystic's clarity allows him or her to see through every illusion, transformation or any other effect within sight that hides the true form of things. Revealed illusions disappear, while transformations remain intact, although the mystic can see what is behind them. 
#### Adept
**Active**. With a [Resolute<-Resolute] test, the mystic can make a Chain of creatures return to their true form. If the first attempt succeeds the mystic can make another attempt for the next creature, and so on until a test is failed. Nothing stops the creatures from transforming again, though.

**Active**. As adept, but the mystic can make transformed creatures reveal their true form and then force them to maintain their original form. A Resolute test is required to make a target maintain its original form. The test is made on the targets' Initiative when/if they try to transform again.
