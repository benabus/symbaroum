## Traits

THIS CHAPTER DESCRIBES the different traits that representatives of the playable races either have or can have. Some of the traits only have one level and come automatically with the selection of a race, at no additional cost in creation points. Others function and cost as abilities, aside from the fact that they are tied to a certain race. Such a trait is optional and the player decides whether or not to purchase it when creating the character.

### CONTACTS

The character has served in an organization or traveled far and wide, and has therefore spun a wide web of contacts. With a successful roll against Persuasive,the character can call to mind a contact that should be able to help with a specific question or in a precarious situation. The contact may not be available directlyt-that depends on who is included in the web of contacts. Suitable factions and people when it comes to specifying the character's contacts are: the Queen's Army, the Queen's Rangers, Witches, Ordo Magica, the Church of Prios, the Noble Houses and Treasure Hunters.

### BUSH CRAFT

The character can survive on meager resources and is used to finding food and shelter in harsh terrain.

With a successful Vigilant test, the character can find enough food and water to feed him-or herself while being on the move in the wilderness or among Davokar's ruins. If the character is part ofta small group (up to five individuals), food and water can be found for them as well, but that will take much more time. The group cannot be on the move during that time.

### LONG-LIVED

Once adulthood is reached, the aging process of the character slows down. The character can live up to two or even three centuries if its life is not shortened by violence, poison or disease. The creature's long lifespan makes it prone to do things at a slow pace, but this is compensated by the attitude that what is worth doing is worth doing well, which over time results in a considerable degree of expertise.

Long-lived has no effect besides what it implies in terms of playing the role.

### PARIAH

The character belongs to a race which is ill-reputed among the ruling majority and is more or less openly discriminated against. Lone individuals in society might be less inclined to prejudice, but the character's social interactions are generally hampered. Persecuted groups tend to stand together against the world and provide each other with aid and support.

When taking on a social challenge, the player has to roll twice and pick the worst result to decide the outcome of the test. On the other hand, the character is awarded a second chance to succeed while interacting with members ofits own race, in which case it only has to roll the dice when it strives to accomplish something which is questionable or next to impossible to achieve.

Additionally, the character starts with only five shillings in its purse.

### PRIVILEGED

The character belongs to a race of high social standing within its society, and is therefore given advantages that others simply cannot have or must pay for, in either silver or hard work, to obtain.

The character gets a second chance to succeed when taking on social challenges within its own society, and does not have to roll the dice unless it strives to accomplish something which is questionable or that may be next to impossible to achieve.

Additionally, the character starts with 50 thaler in its purse.

### ROBUST

The character belongs to a race of creatures that are naturally tall and often continue to grow their entire lives. But there are variations: some grow quickly, others more slowly while some hardly seems to grow at all.

#### Novice
**Special**. The character is close to seven feet tall and very strong. Such a towering body is easier to hit in combat, which is balanced by a greater natural toughness. The character's Defense is based on [Quick -2] and it can only use light armor, which must be custom-made and therefore costs twice the normal price. In return, the character naturally ignores 1D4 damage from each hit taken, in addition to any armor it wears. Furthermore, it can deal 1D4 extra damage with one melee attack each turn.

#### Adept 
**Special**.The character is over eight feet tall, weighs about 500 pounds and has skin as though as bark. A creature like this packs quite the punch but is also easy to hit. The character's Defense is based on [Quick -3] and it can only use light armor, which must be custom-made and costs three times the normal price. In return, the character naturally ignores 1D6 damage from each hit taken, in addition to any armor it wears. Furthermore, it can deal 1D6 extra damage with one melee attack each turn.

#### Master
**Special**. The character is close to ten feet tall, weighs about half a ton and crushes lesser creatures while enemy weapons have a hard time penetrating its stone-like skin. It is very easy to hit a creature of this size, but equally hard to wound it seriously. The character's Defense is based on [Quick -4] and it can only use light armor (custom-made, costing four times the normal price). In return, the character ignores 1D8 damage from each hit taken, in addition to any armor it wears. Finally, it can deal 1D8 extra damage with one melee attack each turn.

### SHAPE SHIFTER

The character has the capability to borrow the appearance of others for a period of time. For young changelings this ability comes naturally, and it can be hard for them not to adopt the appearance and mannerisms of people around them. Mature changelings usually develop greater control over the trait.

#### Novice
**Free**. With a successful die roll against Resolute, the character may adopt a false shape; the form, appearance, voice and clothes of another creature, but not that of a specific individual. The changeling can keep up the appearance for the duration of a scene, but then the illusion fades away. Everyone that the character interacts with will see through the illusion, unless the character succeeds with a [Discreet<-Vigilant] test.

#### Adept 
**Free**. The character may, for a short period of time and with a successful Resolute test. adopt the form of specific individuals that the character has met. and can include clothes and attributes in the image. In combat against multiple opponents, the similarity is good enough to make it hard for enemies to hit their mark -there is a 50% chance that enemies attempting to hit the character hit their depicted companion instead. It takes concentration to maintain the illusory form, which means that the character must make a Resolute test each turn as well as a successful [Resolute<-Damage] test each time the changeling suffers damage. Master Free. With a successful Resolute test the character may adopt the form of a specific individual and maintain it for the duration of a scene. Anyone who speaks with the character will be able to see through the illusion unless the character succeeds with a[Discreet<-Vigilant]. For a character to be able to fool people familiar with the depicted person, he or she must succeed with two tests, first at a distance and then another one if they start a conversation.

### SHORT-LIVED

The character's life is short, even under favorable living conditions. All members of its race tend to reach adulthood in a handful of years, after which they start to lose their youthful vigor so that only a few ever live to see the age of forty. On the other hand, they are quick to learn and adapt to new surroundings, and they are often ready to face the world at the age of five.

Short-lived has no effect besides what it implies in terms of playing the role.

### SURVIVAL INSTINCT

The character belongs to a race with a powerful life-force and an equally powerful will to survive. For some individuals this energy shows itselfin clamorous hollering and an acute restlessness; for others it manifests itself in a more useful survival instinct.

#### Novice
 **Free**. Thanks to its explosive survival instinct. the character may perform one extra Movement Action once per scene.

#### Adept 
**Reaction**. The character trusts its instincts and has learned that rolling with the punches often saves your life. The character's finely honed survival instinct provides it with a permanenta+ 1D4 to Armor.

#### Master
**Free**. There resides a powerful fighting spirit within each member of the character's race, and that spirit can show itself when the character is backed into a corner. The character has nurtured this hot-tempered aggression and may sacrifice a Movement Action once per scene to perform an extra Combat Action.
